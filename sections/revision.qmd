## Preliminaries


::: Theorem
The number $\sqrt{2}$ does not belong to $\Q$.
:::


::: Proof

Aassume by contradiction that 
$$
\sqrt{2} \in \Q \,.
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2-false}

1. Therefore, there exists $q \in \Q$ such that 
$$
q = \sqrt{2} \, .
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2}
2. Since $q \in \Q$, by definition we have
$$
q = \frac{m}{n}
$$
for some $m,n \in \N$ with $n \neq 0$.
3. Recalling (@eq-contradiction-root-2), we then have
$$
\frac{m}{n} = \sqrt{2} \,.
$$
4. We can square the above equation to get
$$
 \frac{m^2}{n^2} = 2 \,.
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2-2}
5. **Withouth loss of generality**, we can **assume** that $m$ and $n$ have no common factors.
    
    
6.  Equation (@eq-contradiction-root-2-2) implies 
$$
m^2 = 2 n^2 \,.
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2-3}
Therefore the integer $m^2$ is an even number. 

   

7. Since $m^2$ is an even number, it follows that also $m$ is an even number. Then there exists $p \in \N$ such that 
$$
m = 2p \,.
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2-4}

   

8. If we substitute (@eq-contradiction-root-2-4) in (@eq-contradiction-root-2-3) we get
$$
m^2 = 2n^2 \, \implies \,  (2p)^2 = 2n^2 \, \implies \,  4 p^2 = 2 n^2
$$
Dividing both terms by $2$, we obtain
$$
n^2 = 2p^2\,. 
$${#eq-contradiction-root-2-5}
9. We now make a series of observations:
    * Equation (@eq-contradiction-root-2-5) says that $n^2$ is even.
    * The same argument in Step 7 guarantees that also $n$ is even.
    * We have already seen that $m$ is even.
    * Therefore $n$ and $m$ are both even.  
    * Hence $n$ and $m$ have $2$ as common factor.
    * But Step 5 says that $n$ and $m$ have no common factors.
    * **Contradiction**
10. Our reasoning has run into a **contradiction**, stemming  from assumption (@eq-contradiction-root-2-false). Therefore (@eq-contradiction-root-2-false) is **FALSE**, and so 
$$
\sqrt{2} \notin \Q \,
$$
ending the proof.

### Set Theory


::: Definition
For two sets $A$ and $B$ we define their **union** as the set
$$
A \cup B := \{ x\, \colon \, x \in A  \, \text{ or } \, x \in B \} \,.
$$
The **intersection** of $A$ and $B$ is defined by
$$
A \cap B := \{ x\, \colon \, x \in A  \, \text{ and } \, x \in B \} \,.
$$
We denote the **empty set** by the symbol $\emptyset$. Two sets are **disjoint** if 
$$
A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$
Given two sets $A$ and $B$, we say that $A$ is **contained** in $B$, in symbols
$$
A \subseteq B  \,,
$$
if all the elements of $A$ are also contained in $B$. Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **equal**, in symbols
$$
A=B \,,
$$
if they contain the same elements. 
:::


::: Proposition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Then 
$$
A=B \quad \iff \quad A \subseteq B \,\, \text{ and } \,\, B \subseteq A \,.
$$

:::



::: Definition

Let $\Omega$ be a set, and $A_n \subseteq \Omega$ a family of subsets, where $n \in \N$. 

1. The **infinte union** of the $A_n$ is the set
$$
\bigcup_{n \in \N} A_n := \{ x \in \Omega \, \colon \, x \in A_n \,\, \text{ for at least one } \,\, n \in \N \} \,.
$$

2. The **infinte intersection** of the $A_n$ is the set 
$$
\bigcap_{n \in \N} A_n := \{ x \in \Omega \, \colon \, x \in A_n \,\, \text{ for all } \,\, n \in \N \} \,.
$$

:::


::: Example 

**Question.**
Define $\Omega:=\N$ and a family $A_n$ by
$$
A_n = \{ n, n+1, n+2, n+3,  \ldots \} \,, \quad n \in \N \,.
$$

1. Prove that
$$
\bigcup_{n \in \N} A_n = \N \,.
$$ {#eq-infinite-union}

2. Prove that 
$$
\bigcap_{n \in \N} A_n = \emptyset \,.
$$ {#eq-infinite-intersection}

**Solution.**

1. Assume that $m \in \cup_n A_n$. Then $m \in A_n$ for at least one $n \in \N$. Since $A_n \subseteq \N$, we conclude that $m \in \N$. This shows 
$$
\bigcup_{n \in \N} A_n \subseteq \N \,.
$$
Conversely, suppose that $m \in \N$. By definition $m \in A_m$. Hence there exists at least one index $n$, $n=m$ in this case, such that $m \in A_n$. Then by definition $m \in \cup_{n \in \N} A_n$, showing that
$$
\N \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \N} A_n \,.
$$
This proves (@eq-infinite-union).

2. Suppose that (@eq-infinite-intersection) is false, i.e., 
$$
\bigcap_{n \in \N} A_n \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
This means there exists some $m \in \N$ such that $m \in \cap_{n \in \N} A_n$. Hence, by definition, $m \in A_n$ for all $n \in \N$. However $m \notin A_{m+1}$, yielding a contradiction. Thus (@eq-infinite-intersection) holds.
:::



::: Definition
Let $A,B \subseteq \Omega$. The **complement** of $A$ with respect to $B$ is the set of elements of $B$ which do not belong to $A$, that is
$$
B \smallsetminus A := \{ x \in \Omega \, \colon \, x \in B \, \text{ and } \, x \notin A \} \,.
$$
In particular, the complement of $A$ with respect to $\Omega$ is denoted by 
$$
A^c := \Omega \smallsetminus A := \{ x \in \Omega \, \colon \, x \notin A \} \,.
$$
:::


::: Example

**Question.** Suppose $A, B \subseteq \Omega$. Prove that
$$
A \subseteq B  \iff B^c \subseteq A^c \,.
$$

**Solution.** Let us prove the above claim:

- First implication $\implies$:  
Suppose that $A \subseteq B$. We need to show that $B^c \subseteq A^c$. Hence, assume $x \in B^c$. By definition this means that $x \notin B$. Now notice that we cannot have that $x \in A$. Indeed, assume $x \in A$.  By assumption we have $A \subseteq B$, hence $x \in B$. But we had assumed $x \in B$, contradiction. Therefore it must be that $x \notin A$. Thus $B^c \subseteq A^c$.

- Second implication $\impliedby$:  Note that, for any set, 
$$
(A^c)^c = A \,.
$$
Hence, by the first implication,
$$
B^c \subseteq A^c \, \implies \, (A^c)^c \subseteq (B^c)^c \, \implies \, A \subseteq B \,.
$$
:::



::: Proposition
## De Morgan's Laws

Suppose $A,B \subseteq \Omega$. Then
$$
(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c  \,, \qquad 
(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c  \,.
$$ 

:::



::: Definition
Let $\Omega$ be a set. The **power set** of $\Omega$ is
$$
\mathcal{P}(\Omega) := \{ A \divider A \subseteq \Omega \}\,.
$$
:::

::: Example

**Question.** Compute the power set of
$$
\Omega = \{ x, y, z \}\,.
$$

**Solution.** $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ has $2^3 = 8$, and
\begin{align}
\mathcal{P}(\Omega) = \{ \emptyset, & \, \{x\} , \,  \{y\} , \, \{z\} , \{x,y\} \\
&  \{x,z\}, \, \{y,z\} , \, \{x,y,z\} \} \,. 
\end{align}
:::



::: Definition

Let $A,B$ be sets. The **product** of $A$ and $B$ is the set of pairs
$$
A \times B := \{ (a,b) \, \colon \, a \in A, \, b \in B \} \,.
$$

:::



### Relations

::: Definition

Suppose $A$ is a set. A **binary relation** $R$ on $A$ is a subset 
$$
R \subseteq A \times A \,.
$$

:::

::: Definition
### Equivalence relation

A binary relation $R$ is called an **equivalence relation** if it satisfies the following properties:

1. **Reflexive**: For each $x \in A$ one has 
$$
(x,x) \in R \,, 
$$

2. **Symmetric**: We have
$$
(x,y) \in R \implies (y,x) \in R
$$


3. **Transitive**: We have
$$
(x,y) \in R \,, \,\, (y,z) \in R  \implies (x,z) \in R 
$$


If $(x,y) \in R$ we write
$$
x \sim y 
$$
and we say that $x$ and $y$ are **equivalent**.

:::



::: Definition
### Equivalence classes

Suppose $R$ is an **equivalence relation** on $A$. The **equivalence class** of an element $x \in A$ is the set
$$
[x]:=\{ y \in A \, \colon \, y \sim x \} \,.
$$
The set of equivalence classes of elements of $A$ with respect to the equivalence relation $R$ is denoted by 
$$
A / R \, := A / \!\sim \, :=  \,\{ [x] \, \colon \, x \in A \} \,.
$$


:::




::: Proposition

Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $A$. Then

1. For each $x \in A$ we have
$$
[x] \neq \emptyset
$$

2. For all $x,y \in A$ it holds
$$
x \sim y \quad \iff \quad  [x] = [y] \,.
$$

:::




::: Example
### Equality is an equivalence relation

**Question.** The equality defines a **binary relation** on $\Q \times \Q$, via
$$
R:=\{ (x,y) \in \Q \times \Q \, \colon \, x=y  \} \,.
$$

1. Prove that $R$ is an **equivalence relation**.
2. Prove that $[x] = \{x\}$ and compute $\Q / R$.

**Solution.** 

1. We need to check that $R$ satisfies the 3 properties of an equivalence relation:

    - Reflexive: It holds, since $x=x$ for all $x \in \Q$,

    - Symmetric: Again $x = y$ if and only if $y = x$,

    - Transitive: If $x = y$ and $y = z$ then $x = z$.

    Therefore, $R$ is an equivalence relation.

2. The class of equivalence of $x \in \Q$ is given by
$$
[x] = \{ x \}\,,
$$
that is, this relation is quite trivial, given that each element of $\Q$ can only be related to itself. The quotient space is then 
$$
\Q / R = \{ [x] \divider x \in \Q \} = \{  \{ x\} \divider x \in \Q \}  \,.
$$

:::



::: Example

**Question.** Let $R$ be the binary relation on the set $\Q$ of rational numbers defined by
$$
x \sim y  \iff x-y \in \Z \,.
$$

1. Prove that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $\Q$.
2. Compute $[x]$ for each $x \in \Q$.
3. Compute $\Q/R$.


**Solution.**

1. We have:

    - Reflexive: Let $x \in \Q$. Then $x-x = 0$ and $0 \in \Z$. Thus $x \sim x$.

    - Symmetric: If $x \sim y$ then $x-y \in \Z$. But then also  
    $$
    -(x-y) = y - x \in \Z
    $$
    and so $y \sim x$.

    - Transitive: Suppose $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$. Then 
    $$
    x - y \in \Z \,  \text{ and } \, y - z \in \Z \,.
    $$
    Thus, we have
    $$
    x-z = (x-y) + (y-z) \in \Z
    $$
    showing that $x \sim z$. 

    Thus, we have shown that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $\Q$.

2. Note that
$$
y -x \in \Z 
$$
is equivalent to
$$
\exists \, n \in \Z \, \text{ s.t. } \, y - x = n
$$
which again is equivalent to 
$$
\exists \, n \in \Z \, \text{ s.t. } \, y = x + n \,.
$$
In summary we have
$$
x \sim y \quad \iff \quad \exists \, n \in \Z \, \text{ s.t. } \, y = x + n \,.
$$
Therefore the equivalence classes with respect to $\sim$ are
$$
 [x] = \{  x + n \ \colon \ n \in \Z  \}  \,.
$$
Each equivalence class has exactly one element in $[0,1) \cap \Q$, meaning that:
$$
\forall x \in \Q \,, \,\, \exists! \, q \in \Q \st  0 \leq q < 1 \, \text{ and } \, q \in [x]\,.
$${#eq-equivalence-rel}
Indeed: take $x \in \Q$ arbitrary. Then $x \in [n,n+1)$ for some 
$n \in \Z$. Setting $q:=x-n$ we obtain that
$$
x = q + n \,, \qquad q \in [0,1) \,,
$$
proving (@eq-equivalence-rel). In particular (@eq-equivalence-rel) implies that for each $x \in \Q$ there exists $q \in [0,1) \cap \Q$ such that
$$
[x] = [q] \,.
$$

3. From Point 2 we conclude that
$$
\Q / R = \{ [x] \divider x \in \Q \} = \{ q \in \Q \divider 0 \leq q <1  \} \,.
$$

::: Definition
### Partial order

A binary relation $R$ on $A$ is called a **partial order** if it satisfies the following properties:

1. **Reflexive**: For each $x \in A$ one has 
$$
(x,x) \in R \,, 
$$

2. **Antisymmetric**: We have
$$
(x,y) \in R \,  \text{ and } \, (y,x) \in R \implies x = y 
$$


3. **Transitive**: We have
$$
(x,y) \in R \,, \,\, (y,z) \in R  \implies (x,z) \in R 
$$
:::




:::  Definition
### Total order

A binary relation $R$ on $A$ is called a **total order relation** if it satisfies the following properties:

1. **Partial order**: $R$ is a partial order on $A$.
2. **Total**: For each $x,y \in A$ we have
$$
(x, y) \in R \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, (y,x) \in R \,.
$$

:::




::: Example
### Set inclusion is a partial order but not total order

**Question.** Let $\Omega$ be a non-empty set and consider its **power set**
$$
\mathcal{P}(\Omega) = \{ A \divider A \subseteq \Omega  \}\,.
$$
The inclusion defines **binary relation** on $\mathcal{P}(\Omega) \times \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$, via
$$
R:=\{ (A,B) \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \times \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \, \colon \, A \subseteq B  \} \,.
$$

1. Prove that $R$ is an **order relation**.
2. Prove that $R$ is **not a total order**.

**Solution.**

1. Check that $R$ is a partial order relation on $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$:
    - Reflexive: It holds, since $A \subseteq A$ for all $A \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$.
    - Antisymmetric: If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$, then $A=B$.
    - Transitive: If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$, then, by definition of inclusion, $A \subseteq C$.

2. In general, $R$ is **not** a total order. For example consider
$$
\Omega = \{x, y\}\,.
$$
Thus
$$
\mathcal{P}(\Omega)  = \{ \emptyset , \, \{x\} , \, \{y\} , \, \{x,y\} \}\,.
$$
If we pick $A=\{x\}$ and $B=\{y\}$ then $A \cap B = \emptyset$, meaning that 
$$
A \not\subseteq B \,, \quad  B \not\subseteq A \,.
$$
This shows $R$ is not a total order.
:::




::: Example
### Inequality is a total order

**Question.** Consider the binary relation
$$
R:=\{ (x,y) \in \Q \times \Q \, \colon \, x \leq y  \} \,.
$$
Prove that $R$ is a **total order relation**.

**Solution.** We need to check that:

1. Reflexive: It holds, since $x \leq x$ for all $x \in \Q$,

2. Antisymmetric: If $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$  then $x = y$.

3. Transitive: If $x \leq y$ and $y \leq z$ then $x \leq z$.

Finally, we halso have that $R$ is a **total order** on $\Q$, since for all $x,y \in \Q$ we have
$$
x \leq y \,\, \text{ or } \,\, y \leq x \,.
$$

### Absolute value

::: Definition
### Absolute value 
For $x \in \R$ we define its **absolute value** as the quantity
$$
|x| = 
\begin{cases}
x  & \text{ if } \, x \geq 0 \\
-x  & \text{ if } \, x < 0 
\end{cases}
$$
:::

::: Proposition
For all $x \in \R$ they hold:

1. $|x| \geq 0$.
2. $|x| = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$.
3. $|x| = |-x|$.

:::


::: {.Lemma #lemma-absolute-value}
Let $x,y \in \R$. Then
$$
|x| \leq y  \iff -y \leq x \leq y \,.
$$
:::

::: Corollary
Let $x,y \in \R$. Then
$$
|x| < y  \iff -y < x < y \,.

::: Theorem
### Triangle inequality  {#theorem-triangle-inequality}

For every $x, y \in \R$ we have
$$
| |x| - |y| | \leq |x+y| \leq |x| + |y| \,.
$$ {#eq-triangle-inequality}
:::




::: Proposition
For any $x,y \in \R$ it holds
$$
||x|-|y|| \leq |x-y| \leq |x|+|y|\,.
$${#eq-triangle-inequality-bis}
Moreover for any  $x,y,z \in \R$ it holds
$$
|x-y| \leq |x-z| + |z-y| \,.

### Induction



::: Definition
### Principle of Inducion

Let $\alpha(n)$ be a statement which depends on $n \in \N$. Suppose that 

1. $\alpha(1)$ is true, and
2. Whenever $\alpha(n)$ is true, then $\alpha(n+1)$ is true.

Then $\alpha(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
:::


::: Example 
### Formula for summing first $n$ natural numbers

**Question.** Prove by induction that the following formula holds for all $n \in \N$:
$$
1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (n-1) + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \,.
$$ {#eq-formula-sum-naturals}


**Solution**. Define
$$
S(n) = 1 + 2 + \ldots + n \,.
$$
This way the formula at (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) is equivalent to
$$
S(n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$

1. It is immediate to check that (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for $n=1$.
2. Suppose (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for $n = k$. Then
\begin{align}
S(k+1) & = 1 + \ldots +  k + (k+1) \\
       & = S(k) + (k+1) \\
       & = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}  + (k+1) \\
& = \frac{ k(k+1) + 2(k+1) }{2} \\
& = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
\end{align}
where in the first equality we used that (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for $n=k$. We have proven that
$$
S(k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\,.
$$
The RHS in the above expression is exactly the RHS of  (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) computed at $n = k+1$. Therefore, we have shown that formula (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for $n = k+1$.

By the Principle of Induction, we conclude that (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for all $n \in \N$.

::: Example
### Bernoulli's inequality

**Question.** Let $x \in \R$ with $x>-1$. Bernoulli's inequality states that
$$
(1+x)^{n} \geq 1+n x \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-bernoulli-inequality}
Prove Bernoulli's inequality by induction.


**Solution.** Let $x \in \mathbb{R}, x>-1$. We prove the statement by induction:

- Base case: (@eq-bernoulli-inequality) holds with equality when $n=1$.

- Induction hypothesis: Let $k \in \N$ and suppose that (@eq-bernoulli-inequality) holds for $n=k$, i.e.,
$$
(1+x)^{k} \geq 1+k x \,.
$$
Then
\begin{align*}
(1+x)^{k+1} & = (1+x)^{k}(1+x) \\
            & \geq(1+k x)(1+x) \\
            & =1+k x+x+k x^{2} \\
            & \geq 1+(k+1) x \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $kx^2 \geq 0$. Then (@eq-bernoulli-inequality) holds for $n=k+1$.

By induction we conclude (@eq-bernoulli-inequality).

## Real Numbers

::: Definition
### Binary operation
A binary operation on a set $K$ is a function 
$$
\circ \ \colon K \times K \to K
$$
which maps the ordered pair $(x,y)$ into $x \circ y$.
:::



::: Definition
Let $K$ be a set and $\circ \ \colon K \times K \to K$ be a binary operation on $K$. We say that:

1. $\circ$ is **commutative** if 
    $$
    x \circ y = y \circ x \,, \quad \, \forall \, x,y \in K
    $$
2. $\circ$ is **associative** if 
    $$
    (x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z) \,, \quad \, \forall \, x,y,z \in K
    $$
3. An element $e \in K$ is called **neutral element** of $\circ$ if
    $$ 
    x \circ e = e \circ x = x \,, \quad \, \forall \, x \in K
    $$
4. Let $e$ be a neutral element of $\circ$ and let $x \in K$. An element $y \in K$ is called an **inverse** of $x$ with respect to $\circ$ if 
$$
x \circ y = y \circ x = e \,.
$$
:::




::: Example

**Question.** Let $K=\{0,1\}$ be a set with binary operation $\circ$ defined by the table
$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 \circ & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
 0     & 1 & 1 \\
 1     & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}	
$$

1. Is $\circ$ commutative? Justify your answer.

2. Is $\circ$ associative? Justify your answer.

**Solution.**

1. We have
$$
0 \circ 1 = 1 \, , \quad 1 \circ 0 = 0
$$
and therefore
$$
0 \circ 1 \neq 1 \circ 0 \,.
$$
showing that $\circ$ is not commutative.

2. We have
$$
(0 \circ 1) \circ 1 = 1 \circ 1 = 0 \,,
$$
while 
$$
0 \circ (1 \circ 1) = 0 \circ 0 = 1 \,,
$$
so that 
$$
(0 \circ 1) \circ 1  \neq 0 \circ (1 \circ 1)\,.
$$
Thus, $\circ$ is not associative.

::: Definition
### Field

Let $K$ be a set with binary operations of **addition** 
$$
+\ \colon K \times K \to K \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x + y 
$$
and **multiplication** 
$$
\cdot\ \colon K \times K \to K \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x \cdot y  = xy \,. 
$$ 
We call the triple $(K, + , \cdot)$ a **field** if:

1. The addition $+$ satisfies: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in K$
    - (A1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$
    x+y = y+x 
    $$
    $$
    (x+y)+z = x+(y+z) 
    $$
    - (A2) **Additive Identity**: There exists a **neutral element** in $K$ for $+$, which we call $0$. It holds:
    $$ 
    x + 0 = 0 + x = x 
    $$
    - (A3) **Additive Inverse**: There exists an **inverse** of $x$ with respect to $+$. We call this element the **additive inverse** of $x$ and denote it by $-x$. It holds
    $$
    x + (-x) = (-x) + x = 0 
    $$

2. The multiplication $\cdot$ satisifes: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in K$
    - (M1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$

::: Proposition
### Uniqueness of neutral elements and inverses

Let $(K,+,\cdot)$ be a field. Then

1. There is a unique element in $K$ with the property of $0$.
2. There is a unique element in $K$ with the property of $1$.
3. For all $x \in K$ there is a unique additive inverse $-x$.
4. For all $x \in K$, $x \neq 0$, there is a unique multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$.
:::

::: Proof
1. Suppose that $0 \in K$ and $\widetilde{0} \in K$ are both neutral element of $+$, that is, they both satisfy (A2). Then 
$$
0 + \widetilde{0} = 0
$$
since $\widetilde{0}$ is a neutral element for $+$. Moreover
$$
\widetilde{0} + 0 = \widetilde{0}
$$
since $0$ is a neutral element for $+$. By commutativity of $+$, see property (A1), we have
$$
0 = 0 + \widetilde{0} = \widetilde{0} + 0 = \widetilde{0} \,,
$$
showing that $0 = \widetilde{0}$. Hence the neutral element for $+$ is unique.
2. Exercise.
3. Let $x \in K$ and suppose that $y, \widetilde{y} \in K$ are both additive inverses of $x$, that is, they both satisfy (A3). Therefore
$$
x + y = 0
$$
since $y$ is an additive inverse of $x$ and
$$
x + \widetilde{y} = 0 
$$
since $\widetilde{y}$ is an additive inverse of $x$. Therefore we can use commutativity and associativity and of $+$, see property (A1), and the fact that $0$ is the neutral element of $+$, to infer
\begin{align*}
y & = y + 0 = y + (x + \widetilde{y}) \\ 
  & = (y + x) + \widetilde{y} = (x + y) + \widetilde{y} \\
  & = 0 + \widetilde{y} = \widetilde{y} \,,    
\end{align*}
concluding that $y = \widetilde{y}$. Thus there is a unique additive inverse of $x$, and 
$$
y = \widetilde{y} = -x \,,
$$
with $-x$ the element from property (A3).
4. Exercise.

### Revisiting Sup and Inf

$$

Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a<b$. Let
$$
A:= (a,b) = \{ x \in \R \divider a < x < b \}\,.
$$
Then
$$
\inf A = a \,, \quad \sup A = b \,.
$$

:::



::: Corollary

Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a<b$. Let

Then 
$$
\min A = \inf A = a \,, \quad \sup A = b \,,
$$ 
$\max A$ does not exist.


:::


::: Proposition

Define the set
$$
A :=  \left\{ \frac1n \divider n \in \N   \right\} \,.
$$
Then
$$
\inf A = 0 \,, \quad \sup A = \max A = 1 \,.
$$
:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* We have
$$
\frac1n \leq 1 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Therefore $1$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since $1 \in A$, by definition of maximum we conclude that 
$$
\max A = 1 \,.
$$
Since the maximum exists, we conclude that also the supremum exists, and
$$
\sup A = \max A =  1 \,.
$$



*Part 2.* We have
$$
\frac1n > 0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
showing that $0$ is a lower bound for $A$. Suppose by contradiction that $0$ is not the infimum. Therefore $0$ is not the largest lower bound. Then there exists $\e \in \R$ such that:

- $\e$ is a lower bound for $A$, that is,
$$
\e \leq \frac1n  \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$${#eq-lower-bound-1-n}

- $\e$ is larger than $0$:
$$
0 < \e \,.
$$

As $\e>0$, by the Archimedean Property there exists $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
0 < \frac{1}{n_0} < \e \,.
$$
This contradicts (@eq-lower-bound-1-n). Thus $0$ is the largest lower bound of $A$, that is, $0 = \inf A$.


*Part 3.* We have that $\min A$ does not exist. Indeed suppose by contradiction that $\min A$ exists. Then 
$$
\min A = \inf A \,.
$$
As $\inf A = 0$ by Part 2, we conclude $\min A = 0$. As $\min A \in A$, we obtain $0 \in A$, which is a contradiction.

### Cardinality

### Cardinality, Finite, Countable, Uncountable {#definition-cardinality}

Let $X$ be a set. The **cardinality** of $X$ is the number of elements in $X$. We denote
the cardinality of $X$ by
$$
|X| := \# \, \mbox{ of elements in } \, X \,.
$$
Further, we say that:

1. $X$ is **finite** if there exists a natural number $n \in \N$ and a bijection
$$
f \colon \{1,2,\ldots, n \} \to X \,.
$$
In particular 
$$
|X| = n \,.
$$

2. $X$ is **countable** if there exists a bijection
$$
f \colon \N \to X  \,.
$$
In this case we denote the cardinality of $X$ by
$$
|X| = |\N| \,.
$$

3. $X$ is **uncountable** if $X$ is neither finite, nor countable.

:::



::: {.Proposition #proposition-countable-subset}

Let $X$ be a countable set and $A \subseteq X$. Then either $A$ is finite or countable.

:::



::: Example

**Question.** Prove that $X = \{a,b,c\}$ is finite. 

**Solution.** Set $Y=\{ 1,2,3\}$. The function $f \colon X \to Y$ defined by
$$
f(1)=a \,, \quad f(2) = b \,, \quad f(3) = c \,,
$$
is bijective. Therefore $X$ is finite, with $|X| = 3$.

:::




::: Example

**Question.** Prove that the set of natural numbers $\N$ is countable. 

**Solution.** The function $f \colon X \to \N$ defined by
$$
f(n):=n \,,
$$
is bijective. Therefore $X = \N$ is countable.

:::



::: Example

**Question.** Let $X$ be the set of even numbers
$$
X = \{ 2n \divider n \in \N \} \,.
$$
Prove that $X$ is countable.

**Solution.** Define the map $f \colon \N \to X$ by
$$
f(n):= 2n \,.
$$
We have that:

1. $f$ is injective, because 
$$
f(m)=f(k) \, \implies \, 2m=2k \, 
\quad \, m=k \,.
$$

2. $f$ is surjective: Suppose that $m \in X$. By definition of $X$, there exists $n \in \N$ such that $m = 2n$. Therefore, $f(n) = m$.

    
We have shown that $f$ is bijective. Thus, $X$ is countable.

:::



::: Example

**Question.** Prove that the set of integers $\Z$ is countable. 

**Solution.** Define $f \colon \N \to \Z$ by 
$$
f(n):= 
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{n}{2}  & \,\, \mbox{ if } \, n \, \mbox{ even }  \\
-\dfrac{n+1}{2}  & \,\, \mbox{ if } \, n \, \mbox{ odd }  
\end{cases}
$$
For example
\begin{align*}
f(0) & = 0 \,, \quad f(1) = -1 \,, \quad f(2) = 1 \,, \quad f(3) = -2 \,, \\
f(4) & = 2 \,, \quad f(5) = -3 \,, \quad f(6) = 3 \,, \quad f(7) = -4 \,.
\end{align*}
We have:

1. $f$ is injective: Indeed, suppose that $m \neq n$. If $n$ and $m$ are both even or both odd we have, respectively
\begin{align*}
f(m) = \frac{m}{2} & \neq \frac{n}{2} = f(n)  \\
f(m) =  -\frac{m+1}{2} & \neq  - \frac{n+1}{2} = f(n) \,.
\end{align*}
If instead $m$ is even and $n$ is odd, we get
$$
f(m) = \frac{m}{2} \neq  - \frac{n+1}{2} = f(n)  \,,
$$
since the LHS is positive and the RHS is negative. The case when $m$ is odd and $n$ even is 
similar.  

2. $f$ is surjective: Let $z \in \Z$. If $z \geq 0$, then $m:=2z$ belongs to $\N$, is even, and
$$
f(m) = f(2z) = z \,.
$$
If instead $z < 0$, then $m := -2z -1$ belongs to $\N$, is odd, and
$$
f(m) = f(-2z-1) = z \,.
$$
    
Therefore $f$ is bijective, showing that $\Z$ is countable.

Alternatively, we can proceed formally: We just need to recall that
$i^2$ has to be replaced with $-1$:
\begin{align*}
z \cdot w & = (-2+3 i) \cdot (1 -  i) \\ 
            & = - 2 + 2i + 3i - 3 i^2  \\

w := \frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+ i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \,.
$$
We need to check that $z \cdot w = 1$
\begin{align*}
z \cdot w & = (x+i y) \cdot \left(\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+ i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \right) \\
& = \left(\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}} - \frac{y \cdot(-y)}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\right) + i \, \left(\frac{x \cdot(-y)}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+\frac{x y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\right) \\
& =1 \,,
\end{align*}
so indeed $z^{-1}=w$.

:::



::: Example

**Question.** Let $z = 3 + 2 i$. Compute $z^{-1}$. 


**Solution.** By the formula in Propostion \ref{proposition-C-multiplicative-inverse-bis} we immediately get
$$
z^{-1} = \frac{3}{3^{2}+2^{2}} +  \, \frac{-2}{3^{2}+2^{2}} \, i = 
\frac{3}{13}-\frac{2}{13} \, i  \,.
$$
Alternatively, we can proceed formally:
\begin{align*}
(3+2 i)^{-1} & = \frac{1}{3+2 i} \\ 
             & = \frac{1}{3+2 i} \, \frac{3-2 i}{3-2 i} \\
             & = \frac{3-2 i}{3^2+2^2} \\
             & = \frac{3}{13}-\frac{2}{13} i  \,,
\end{align*}
and obtain the same result.

::: Example

**Question.** Let $w=1+i$ and $z=3-i$. Compute $\frac{w}{z}$.

**Solution.** We compute $w/z$ using the two options we have:

1. Using the formula for the inverse from Proposition \ref{proposition-C-multiplicative-inverse-bis} we compute
\begin{align*}
z^{-1} & = \frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}} + i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \\
       & = \frac{3}{3^2 + 1^2} - i \, \frac{-1}{3^2 + 1^2} \\
       & = \frac{3}{10} + \frac{1}{10} \, i
\end{align*}
and therefore
\begin{align*}
\frac{w}{z} & = w \cdot z^{-1} \\
            & = (1 + i) \, \left(  \frac{3}{10} + \frac{1}{10} \, i \right) \\
            & = \left(\frac{3}{10}-\frac{1}{10}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{10}+\frac{3}{10}\right) i \\
            & = \frac{2}{10}+\frac{4}{10} i \\
            & = \frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5} i
\end{align*}

2. We proceed formally, using the 
multiplication by $1$ trick. We have
\begin{align*}
\frac{w}{z} & = \frac{1+i}{3-i}  \\
            & = \frac{1+i}{3-i} \frac{3+i}{3+i} \\
            & = \frac{3-1+(3+1) i}{3^2+1^2} \\
            & =\frac{2}{10}+\frac{4}{10} i \\
            & = \frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5} i

$$
-2+2 i = \sqrt{8} e^{i \frac{3}{4} \pi}

by Example \ref{example-exponential-form}. Hence
$$
(-2+2 i)^{4}=\left(\sqrt{8} e^{i \frac{3}{4} \pi}\right)^{4}=8^{2} e^{i 3 \pi}=-64 \,,

where we used that 
$$
e^{i 3 \pi} = e^{i \pi} = \cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi) = - 1

3. $z^{2}+2 z+3=0$

**Solution.**

1. We have that
$$
\Delta = (-6)^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 12 > 0
$$
Therefore the equation has two distinct real solutions, given by
$$
z=\frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{12}}{2 \cdot 3}=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{12}}{6}=1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
$$
In particular we have the factorization
$$
3 z^{2}-6 z+2  = 3 \left( z - 1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \right) \left( z - 1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \right) \,.

2. We have that 
$$
\Delta = (-8)^{2}-4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 0 \,.

Therefore there exists one solution with multiplicity $2$. This

z=\frac{-(-8)}{2 \cdot 4} = 1 \,.

In particular we have the factorization

Therefore there are two complex solutions given by

       & = 8+6 i-8+2 i \\

Therefore $\Delta \in \C$. We have to find solutions $S_1$ and $S_2$ to the equation
$$
z^2 = \Delta = 8i \,.
$${#eq-example-complex-delta-2}
We look for solutions of the form $z=a+ i b$. Then we must have that
$$
z^{2}=(a+ ib)^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}+2 a b i = 8 i \,.
$$
Thus
$$
a^{2}-b^{2}=0 \,, \quad 2 a b = 8  \,.
$$ 
From the first equation we conclude that $|a|=|b|$. From the second equation we have that $ab=4$, and therefore $a$ and $b$ must have the same sign. Hence $a=b$, and 
$$
2 a b = 8 \quad \implies \quad a = b = \pm 2 \,.
$$
From this we conclude that the solutions to (@eq-example-complex-delta-2)
are 
$$
S_{1} = 2+2 i \,, \quad  S_{2}=-2-2 i \,. 
$$
 Hence the solutions to (@eq-example-complex-delta) are

z_1 & = \frac{3+i+S_{1}}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}}  = 3 + i + S_{1} \\
    & = 3 + i + 2 + 2i = 5 + 3i \,,

\begin{align*}

    & = 3+i -2 - 2i  = 1 - i \,.

In particular, the given polynomial factorizes as
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} z^{2}-(3+i) z+(4-i) & = \frac12 (z - z_1)(z-z_2) \\
                                & = \frac12 (z - 5 - 3i)(z - 1 + i) \,.

Using the quadratic formula, we see that the above is solved by $z=2$ and $z=-3$.
Therefore the given polynomial factorizes as
$$
z^{3}-7 z+6 = (z-1)(z-2)(z+3) \,.

### Roots of unity

::: Theorem

Let $n \in \N$ and consider the equation
$$
z^{n}=1 \,.
$${#eq-root-unity-1}
All the $n$ solutions to (@eq-root-unity-1) are given by
$$
z_k = \exp \left(i \frac{2 \pi k}{n}\right) \,, \quad k = 0, \ldots, n-1 \,,
$$
where $\exp(x)$ denotes $e^x$.

:::


::: Definition 

The $n$ solutions to 
$$
z^{n}=1
$$ 
are called the **roots of unity**.

:::


::: Example 

**Question.** Find all the solutions to
$$
z^{4}=1 \,.
$$ 

**Solution.** The $4$ solutions are given by
$$
z_k = \exp \left(i \frac{2 \pi k}{4} \right) = \exp \left(i \frac{\pi k}{2} \right)  \,,
$$
for $k=0,1,2,3$. We compute:
\begin{align*}
z_0 & = e^{i 0} = 1 \,, & \quad & z_1 = e^{i \frac{\pi}{2}}=i \,, \\ 
z_2 & = e^{i \pi}=-1 \,, & \quad & z_3 = e^{i \frac{3 \pi}{2}}=-i \, .
\end{align*}
Note that for $k=4$ we would again get the solution $z=e^{i 2 \pi}=1$.

for $k=0,1,2$. We compute:
$$
z_0=e^{i 0}=1, \quad z_1=e^{i \frac{2 \pi}{3}}, \quad z_2=e^{i \frac{4 \pi}{3}} .

We can write $z_1$ and $z_2$ in cartesian form:
$$
z_1 = e^{i \frac{2 \pi}{3}}=\cos \left(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)=-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i

where $\sqrt[n]{|c|}$ is the $n$-th root of the real number $|c|$, and $\theta = \arg(c)$.

**Solution.** Set 
$$
c:=9\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right) \,.
$$
The complex number $c$ is already in the trigonometric form, so that we can immediately obtain
$$
|c| = 9 \,, \quad \theta = \arg(c) = \frac{\pi}{3} \,.

## Sequences in $\R$


::: Definition 
### Convergent sequence  {#definition-convergent-sequence}

The real sequence $(a_n)$ **converges** to $a$, or equivalently has limit $a$, denoted by
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=a \,,
$$
if for all $\e \in \mathbb{R}, \e>0$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that for all $n \in \N, n \geq N$ it holds that 
$$
\left|a_{n}-a\right| < \e \,.
$$
Using quantifiers, we can write this as
$$
\forall \, \e>0 , \, \exists \, N \in \N \st \forall \, n \geq N \,, \,\left|a_{n}-a\right| < \e \,.
$$
The sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ is **convergent** if it admits limit.

:::


::: {.Theorem  #theorem-one-over-np}
Let $p>0$. Then
$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n^{p}}=0 \,.
$$
:::

::: Proof

Let $p>0$. We have to show that
$$
\forall \e>0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|\frac{1}{n^{p}}-0\right| < \e \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$. Choose $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
N > \frac{1}{\e^{1 / p}} \,.
$${#eq-theorem-one-over-np-1}
Let $n \geq N$. Since $p>0$, we have $n^{p} \geq N^{p}$, which implies 
$$
\frac{1}{n^p} \leq \frac{1}{N^p} \,.
$$
By (@eq-theorem-one-over-np-1) we deduce
$$
\frac{1}{N^p} < \e \,.
$$
Then
$$
\left|\frac{1}{n^{p}}-0\right|=\frac{1}{n^{p}} \leq \frac{1}{N^{p}} < \e \,.
$$

:::



::: Example 

**Question.** Using the definition of convergence, prove that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{2n+3} = \frac{1}{2} \,.
$$

**Solution.**

1. *Rough Work:* Let $\e>0$. We want to find $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\left|\frac{n}{2n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| < \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
To this end, we compute:
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{n}{2 n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| & 
=\left|\frac{2n -(2n + 3)}{2(2n +3)}\right| \\
& =\left|\frac{- 3}{4n + 6}\right| \\
& = \frac{3}{4n + 6} \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{n}{2n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| < \e
\quad \iff &  \quad
\frac{3}{4n + 6} < \e \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
\frac{4n + 6}{3} > \frac{1}{\e} \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
4n + 6 > \frac{3}{\e} \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
4n  > \frac{3}{\e} - 6 \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
n  > \frac{3}{4\e} - \frac{6}{4} \,.
\end{align*}
Looking at the above equivalences, it is clear that $N \in \N$ has to be chosen so that
$$
N  > \frac{3}{4\e} - \frac{6}{4} \,.
$$


2. *Formal Proof:* We have to show that
$$
\forall \e>0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|\frac{n}{2n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| < \e  \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$. Choose $N \in \N$ such that
$$
N > \frac{3}{4\e} - \frac{6}{4}   \,.
$${#eq-example-limit-1}
By the rough work shown above, inequality (@eq-example-limit-1) is equivalent to 
$$
 \frac{3}{4N + 6} < \e \,.
$$
Let $n \geq N$. Then
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{n}{2n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| 
& = \frac{3}{4 n+ 6 } \\
& \leq \frac{3}{4 N+ 6 } \\
& < \e \,,
\end{align*}
where in the third line we used that $n \geq N$.

::: Definition
### Divergent sequence

We say that a sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ in $\R$ is **divergent** if it is not convergent.

:::




::: {.Theorem #theorem-1-minus-n}
Let $\left(a_{n}\right)$ be the sequence defined by
$$
a_{n}=(-1)^{n} \,.
$$
Then $\left(a_{n}\right)$ does not converge. 

:::



::: Proof

Suppose by contradiction that $a_n \to a$ for some $a \in \R$. Let
$$
\e :=\frac12 \,.
$$
Since $a_n \to a$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
|a_n - a| < \e = \frac13  \, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
If we take $n = 2N$, then $n \geq N$ and
$$
|a_{2N} - a| = | 1 - a | < \frac12 \,. 
$$
If we take $n = 2N + 1$, then $n \geq N$ and
$$
|a_{2N+1} - a| = | -1 - a | < \frac12 \,. 
$$
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
2 & = |  (1 - a) - (-1 - a) | \\
  & \leq |1 - a| + |-1 - a| \\
  & < \frac12 + \frac12 = 1 \,,
\end{align*}
which is a contradiction. Hence $(a_n)$ is divergent.

\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} = b \,.
$$
Then $a=b$.
:::





::: Definition 
### Bounded sequence  {#definition-bounded-sequence}

A sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ is called **bounded** if there exists a constant $M \in \R$, with $M>0$, such that
$$
\left|a_{n}\right| \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$

:::


::: {.Theorem  #theorem-convergent-bounded}

Every convergent sequence is bounded.

:::



::: Example

The sequence 
$$
a_n = (-1)^n
$$
is bounded but not convergent.

:::


::: {.Corollary   #corollary-convergent-bounded}

If a sequence is not bounded, then the sequence does not converge.

:::


::: Remark

For a sequence $(a_n)$ to be unbounded, it means that
$$

### Algebra of limits {#theorem-algebra-limits} 

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\left(b_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be sequences in $\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=a \,, \quad  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} b_{n}=b \,,
$$
for some $a,b \in \R$. Then,

1. Limit of sum is the sum of limits:
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(a_{n} \pm b_{n}\right)=a \pm b
$$

2. Limit of product is the product of limits: 
$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(a_{n}  b_{n}\right) = a  b 
$$

3. If $b_{n} \neq 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $b \neq 0$, then 
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}\right)=\frac{a}{b}

::: {.Example  #example-limit-ploynomial}

**Question.** Prove that

$$


**Solution.** We can rewrite
$$
\frac{3 n}{7 n+4}=\frac{3}{7+\dfrac{4}{n}}
$$
From Theorem \ref{theorem-one-over-np}, we know that 
$$
\frac{1}{n} \rightarrow 0 \,.
$$
Hence, it follows from Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 2 that 
$$
\frac{4}{n} = 4 \cdot \frac1n \rightarrow 4 \cdot 0 = 0 \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 1 we have
$$
7 + \frac{4}{n} \rightarrow  7 + 0 = 7 \,.
$$
Finally we can use Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 3 to infer
$$
\frac{3 n}{7 n+4}=\frac{3}{7+\dfrac{4}{n}} \rightarrow \frac{3}{7} \,.
$$

::: {.Example #example-algebra-of-limits-2}

**Question.** Prove that
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3} = \frac{1}{2} \,.
$$

**Solution.** Factor $n^2$ to obtain
$$
\frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3} = \frac{1-\dfrac{1}{n^{2}}}{2-\dfrac{3}{n^{2}}} \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-one-over-np} we have
$$
\frac{1}{n^2} \to 0 \,.
$$
We can then use the Algebra of Limits Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 2 to infer
$$
\frac{3}{n^2} \to 3 \cdot 0 = 0
$$
and Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 1 to get
$$
1 - \frac{1}{n^2} \to 1 - 0 = 1 \,, \quad 
2 - \frac{3}{n^2} \to 2 - 0 = 2 \,.
$$
Finally we use Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 3 and conclude
$$
 \frac{1-\dfrac{1}{n^{2}}}{2-\dfrac{3}{n^{2}}} \to \frac{1}{2} \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty } \, \frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \, \frac{1-\dfrac{1}{n^{2}}}{2-\dfrac{3}{n^{2}}} = \frac{1}{2} \,.

:::




::: Example 

**Question.** Prove that the sequence
$$
a_n = \frac{4 n^{3}+8 n+1}{7 n^{2}+2 n+1}
$$
does not converge.

**Solution.** To show that the sequence $\left(a_n\right)$ does not converge, we divide by the largest power in the denominator, which in this case is $n^2$
\begin{align*}
a_n & = \frac{4 n^{3}+8 n+1}{7 n^{2}+2 n+1} \\
    & =\frac{4 n+ \dfrac{8}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} }{7+  \dfrac{2}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} } \\
    & = \frac{b_n}{c_n}
\end{align*}
where we set 
$$
b_n := 4 n+ \dfrac{8}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}}\,, \quad
c_n := 7 + \dfrac{2}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} \,.
$$
Using the Algebra of Limits Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} we see that
$$
c_n = 7+  \dfrac{2}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}}  \to 7 \,.
$$
Suppose by contradiction that
$$
a_n \to a
$$
for some $a \in \R$. Then, by the Algebra of Limits, we would infer
$$
b_n = c_n \cdot a_n \to 7 a \,,
$$
concluding that $b_n$ is convergent to $7a$. We have that
$$
b_n = 4n + d_n \,, \quad d_n := \dfrac{8}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} \,.
$$
Again by the Algebra of Limits Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} we get that 
$$
d_n =  \dfrac{8}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} \to 0 \,,
$$
and hence
$$
4n = b_n - d_n \to 7a - 0 = 7a \,.
$$
This is a contradiction, since the sequence $(4n)$ is unbounded, and hence cannot be convergent. Hence $(a_n)$ is not convergent.
:::


::: Example 

**Question.** Define the sequence

 a_n := \frac{2 n^{3}+7 n+1}{5 n+9} \cdot \frac{8 n+9}{6 n^{3}+8 n^{2}+3} \,.
$$
Prove that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty}  a_n = \frac{8}{15} \,.
$$


**Solution.** The first fraction in $(a_n)$ does not converge, as it is unbounded. Therefore we cannot use Point 2 in Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} directly. However, we note that
\begin{align*}
a_{n} & =\frac{2 n^{3}+7 n+1}{5 n+9} \cdot \frac{8 n+9}{6 n^{3}+8 n^{2}+3} \\
& = \frac{8 n+9}{5 n+9} \cdot \frac{2 n^{3}+7 n+1}{6 n^{3}+8 n^{2}+3} \,.
\end{align*}
Factoring out $n$ and $n^3$, respectively, and using the Algebra of Limits, we see that
$$
\frac{8 n+9}{5 n+9}=\frac{8+9 / n}{5+9 / n} \to \frac{8+0}{5+0}=\frac{8}{5}
$$
and
$$
\frac{2+7 / n^{2}+1 / n^{3}}{6+8 / n+3 / n^{3}} \to \frac{2+0+0}{6+0+0}=\frac{1}{3}

Therefore Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 2 ensures that

**Solution.** The largest power of $n$ in the denominator is $n^{3/2}$. Hence we factor out $n^{3/2}$
\begin{align*}
a_n & = \frac{n^{7 / 3}+2 \sqrt{n}+7}{4 n^{3 / 2}+5 n} \\
    & = \frac{n^{7 / 3-3 / 2}+2 n^{1/2 - 3/2} + 7  n^{-3 / 2}}{4 + 5 n^{-3/2} } \\
    & = \frac{n^{5/6}+2 n^{- 1} + 7  n^{-3 / 2}}{4 + 5 n^{-3/2} } \\
    & = \frac{b_n}{c_n}
\end{align*}
where we set
$$
b_n := n^{5/6}+2 n^{- 1} + 7  n^{-3 / 2} \,, \quad 
c_n := 4 + 5 n^{-3/2} \,.

$$


**Solution.** We first rewrite
\begin{align*}
a_n & = \sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}-3 n \\
& = \frac{\left(\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}-3 n\right)\left(\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+3 n\right)}{\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+3 n} \\

& =\frac{3 n+1}{\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+3 n} \, .

The biggest power of $n$ in the denominator is $n$. Therefore we factor out $n$:

& =\frac{3+ \dfrac{1}{n} }{\sqrt{9+ \dfrac{3}{n} + \dfrac{1}{n^{2}}} + 3 } \,.

By the Algebra of Limits we have
$$

Therefore we can use Theorem \ref{theorem-square-root-limit} to infer

Note that 
$$

by the Algebra of Limits. Therefore 
$$
\sqrt{9+ \dfrac{3}{n}  + \dfrac{1}{ n^2 }}  \to \sqrt{9} = 3

$$

The numerator

is instead unbounded. Therefore $(a_n)$ is not convergent, by the Algebra of Limits and the usual contradiction argument.

## Limit Tests


In this section we discuss a number of *Tests* to determine whether a sequence converges or not. These are known as **Limit Tests**.


### Squeeze Theorem


When a sequence $(a_n)$ oscillates, it is difficult to compute the limit. Examples of terms which produce oscillations are
$$
(-1)^n \,, \quad  \sin(n) \,, \quad \cos(n) \,. 
$$
In such instance it might be useful to compare $(a_n)$ with other sequences whose limit is known. If we can prove that $(a_n)$ is *squeezed* between two other sequences with the same limiting value, then we can show that also $(a_n)$ converges to this value.

Let $\e>0$. Since $b_{n} \to L$ and $c_n \to L$ , there exist $N_1, N_2 \in \N$ such that 
\begin{align*}
-\e < b_n - L < \e \,, \,\, \forall \, n \geq N_1 \,,  \\
- \e < c_n - L < \e \,, \,\, \forall \, n \geq N_2 \,. 
\end{align*}
Set
$$
N := \max\{N_1,N_2\} \,.
$$
Let $n \geq N$. Using the assumption that $b_n \leq a_{n} \leq c_{n}$, we get
$$
b_n - L  \leq a_{n} - L \leq c_{n} - L \,.
$$
In particular
$$
- \e < b_n - L  \leq a_n - L \leq b_n - L < \e \,.
$$
The above implies 
$$
- \e < a_n - L < \e  \quad \implies \quad \left|a_{n}-L\right| < \e \,.

$$

**Solution.** For all $n \in \N$ we can estimate
$$
-1 \leq(-1)^{n} \leq 1 \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
\frac{-1}{n} \leq \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Moreover
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{-1}{n}= -1 \cdot 0=0 \,, \quad 
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0 \,.

**Question.** Prove that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\cos (3 n) + 9 n^{2}}{11 n^{2}+15 \sin (17 n)} = \frac{9}{11} \,.
$$


**Solution.** We know that 
$$
-1 \leq \cos(x) \leq 1 \,, \quad - 1 \leq \sin(x) \leq 1 \,, \quad \forall \, x \in \R \,.
$$
Therefore, for all $n \in \N$
$$
- 1 \leq \cos(3n) \leq 1 \,, \quad -1 \leq \sin(17n) \leq 1 \,.
$$
We can use the above to estimate the numerator in the given sequence:
$$
-1 + 9 n^{2} \leq \cos (3 n)+9 n^{2} \leq 1+ 9 n^{2} \,.
$${#eq-squeeze-example-1}
Concerning the denominator, we have
$$
11 n^{2}-15 \leq 11 n^{2}+15 \sin (17 n) \leq  11 n^{2} + 15
$$
and therefore
$$
\frac{1}{11 n^{2} + 15} \leq \frac{1}{11 n^{2}+15 \sin (17 n)} \leq \frac{1}{11 n^{2}-15} \,.
$${#eq-squeeze-example-2}
Putting together (@eq-squeeze-example-1)-(@eq-squeeze-example-2) we obtain 
$$
\frac{-1 + 9 n^{2}}{11 n^{2} + 15} \leq \frac{\cos (3 n)+9 n^{2}}{11 n^{2}+15 \sin (17 n)} \leq \frac{1+ 9 n^{2}}{11 n^{2}-15} \,.
$$
By the Algebra of Limits we infer
$$
\frac{-1+9 n^{2}}{11 n^{2}+15}=\frac{-\dfrac{1}{n^{2}} + 9}{11 + \dfrac{15}{n^{2}}} \to \frac{0+9}{11+0}=\frac{9}{11}
$$
and
$$
\frac{1+9 n^{2}}{11 n^{2} - 15}=\frac{ \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} + 9}{ 11 - \dfrac{15}{n^{2}}} \to \frac{0+9}{11+0}=\frac{9}{11} \,.
$$
Applying the Squeeze Theorem \ref{theorem-squeeze} we conclude
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\cos (3 n)+ 9 n^{2}}{11 n^{2}+15 \sin (17 n)}=\frac{9}{11} \,.

::: Warning

Suppose that the sequences $(a_n), (b_n), (c_n)$ satisfy
$$
b_n \leq a_n \leq c_n \,, \quad \forall n \in \N \,,
$$
and
$$
b_n \to L_1 \,, \quad c_n \to L_2 \,, \quad L_1 \neq L_2 \,.
$$
In general, we cannot conclude that $a_n$ converges.

:::


::: Example 

Consider the sequence
$$
a_n = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right) (-1)^n  \,.
$$
For all $n \in \N$ we can bound
$$
- 1 - \frac{1}{n} \leq \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right) (-1)^n   \leq 1 + \frac{1}{n}  \,.
$$
However 
$$
- 1 - \frac{1}{n} \longrightarrow - 1 - 0 = -1 
$$
and
$$
1 + \frac{1}{n}  \longrightarrow  1 + 0 = 1 \,.
$$
Since 
$$
- 1 \neq 1 \,,
$$
we cannot apply the Squeeze Theorem \ref{theorem-squeeze} to conclude convergence of $(a_n)$. Indeed, $(a_n)$ is a divergent sequence.

*Proof.* Suppose by contradiction that $a_n \to a$. We have
$$
a_n = (-1)^n + \frac{(-1)^n}{n} = b_n + c_n
$$
where
$$
b_n := (-1)^n \,, \quad c_n := \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \,.
$$
We have seen in Example \ref{example-squeeze} that $c_n \to 0$. Therefore, 
by the Algebra of Limits, we have
$$
b_n = a_n - c_n \longrightarrow a - 0 = a \,.
$$
However, Theorem \ref{theorem-1-minus-n} says that the sequence
$b_n = (-1)^n$ diverges. Contradiction. Hence $(a_n)$ diverges.

### Geometric sequences


::: Definition 

A sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ is called a **geometric sequence** if
$$
a_{n}=x^{n} \,,
$$
for some $x \in \R$.

:::


The value of $|x|$ determines whether or not a geometric sequence converges, as shown in the following theorem.


::: Theorem 
### Geometric Sequence Test   {#theorem-geometric-sequence}

Let $x \in \R$ and let $\left(a_{n}\right)$ be the sequence defined by
$$
a_{n}:=x^{n} \,.
$$
We have:

1. If $|x|<1$, then 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} a_{n} = 0 \,.
$$

2. If $|x|>1$, then sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ is unbounded, and hence divergent.

:::



::: Warning

The Geometric Sequence Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-sequence} does not address the case
$$
|x|=1 \,.
$$
This is because, in this case, the sequence 
$$
a_n = x^n 
$$
might converge or diverge, depending on the value of $x$. Indeed, 
$$
|x| = 1 \quad \implies \quad x = \pm 1 \,.
$$
We therefore have two cases:

- $x = 1$: Then 
$$
a_n = 1^n = 1
$$
so that $a_n \to 1$ and $(a_n)$ is convergent.

- $x=-1$: Then
$$
a_n = x^n = (-1)^n
$$
which is divergent by Theorem \ref{theorem-1-minus-n}.

:::



To prove Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-sequence} we need the following inequality, known as Bernoulli's inequality.


::: Lemma 
### Bernoulli's inequality  {#lemma-bernoulli}

Let $x \in \R$ with $x>-1$. Then
$$
(1+x)^{n} \geq 1+n x \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-bernoulli-inequality}

:::


::: Proof

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}, x>-1$. We prove the statement by induction:

- Base case: (@eq-bernoulli-inequality) holds with equality when $n=1$.

- Induction hypothesis: Let $k \in \N$ and suppose that (@eq-bernoulli-inequality) holds for $n=k$, i.e.,
$$
(1+x)^{k} \geq 1+k x \,.
$$
Then
\begin{align*}
(1+x)^{k+1} & = (1+x)^{k}(1+x) \\
            & \geq(1+k x)(1+x) \\
            & =1+k x+x+k x^{2} \\
            & \geq 1+(k+1) x \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $kx^2 \geq 0$. Then (@eq-bernoulli-inequality) holds for $n=k+1$.

By induction we conclude (@eq-bernoulli-inequality).

:::


We are ready to prove Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-sequence}.


::: Proof 
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-sequence}

*Part 1. The case $|x|<1$*. 

If $x=0$, then
$$
a_n = x^n = 0 
$$
so that $a_n \to 0$. Hence assume $x \neq 0$. We need to prove that
$$
\forall \, \e> 0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st 
\forall \, n \geq N \,, \,\, |x^n - 0| < \e \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$. We have 
$$
|x| < 1 \quad \implies \quad \frac{1}{|x|} > 1 \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
|x|= \frac{1}{1+u} \,, \quad u:=\frac{1}{|x|} - 1 > 0 \,.
$$
Let $N \in \N$ be such that 
$$
N > \frac{1}{\e u} \,,
$$
so that 
$$
\frac{1}{N u} < \e \,.
$$
Let $n \geq N$. Then
\begin{align*}
\left|x^{n}-0\right| & =|x|^{n} \\
                     & = \left(\frac{1}{1+u}\right)^{n} \\
                     & =\frac{1}{(1+u)^{n}} \\
                     & \leq \frac{1}{1+n u} \\
                     & \leq \frac{1}{n u} \\
                     & \leq \frac{1}{N u} \\
                     & < \e \,,
\end{align*}
where we used Bernoulli's inequality (@eq-bernoulli-inequality) in the first inequality.


*Part 2. The case $|x|>1$*. 

To prove that $(a_n)$ does not converge, we prove that it is unbounded. 
This means showing that
$$
\forall \, M > 0 \,, \, \exists n \in \N \st  \left| a_{n}\right| >M \,.
$$
Let $M > 0$. We have two cases: 

- $0 < M \leq 1$: Choose $n=1$. Then
$$
\left|a_{1}\right|=|x|>1 \geq M \,.
$$

- $M>1$: Choose $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
n> \frac{\log M}{\log |x|} \,.
$$ 
Note that $\log |x|>0$ since $|x|>1$. Therefore
\begin{align*}
n>\frac{\log M}{\log |x|} & \iff n \log |x|>\log M \\
                          & \iff \log |x|^n>\log M \\
                          & \iff |x|^{n}>M \,.
\end{align*}
Then 
$$
\left|a_{n}\right|=\left|x^{n}\right|=|x|^{n} > M \,.
$$


Hence $(a_n)$ is unbounded. By Corollary \ref{corollary-convergent-bounded} we conclude that $(a_n)$ is divergent. 


:::






::: Example 

We can apply Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-sequence} to prove convergence
or divergence for the following sequences.

1. We have
$$
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n} \longrightarrow 0
$$
since 
$$
\left|\frac{1}{2}\right|=\frac{1}{2}<1 \,.
$$

2. We have
$$
\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^{n} \longrightarrow 0
$$
since 
$$
\left|\frac{-1}{2}\right|=\frac{1}{2}<1 \,.
$$

3. The sequence 
$$
a_n = \left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)^{n}
$$ 
does not converge, since 
$$
\left|\frac{-3}{2}\right|=\frac{3}{2}>1 \,.
$$

4. As $n \rightarrow \infty$,
$$
\frac{3^{n}}{(-5)^{n}}=\left(-\frac{3}{5}\right)^{n} \longrightarrow 0
$$
since 
$$
\left|-\frac{3}{5}\right|=\frac{3}{5}<1 \,.
$$

5. The sequence 
$$
a_{n}=\frac{(-7)^{n}}{2^{2 n}}
$$ 
does not converge, since
$$
\frac{(-7)^{n}}{2^{2 n}}=\frac{(-7)^{n}}{\left(2^{2}\right)^{n}}=\left(-\frac{7}{4}\right)^{n}
$$
and 
$$
\left|-\frac{7}{4}\right|=\frac{7}{4}>1  \,.

### Ratio Test



::: Theorem 
### Ratio Test {#theorem-ratio-test}

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)$ be a sequence in $\R$ such that
$$
a_{n} \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$ 


1. Suppose that the following limit exists:
$$
L:=\lim_{n \to \infty}\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| \,.
$$
Then,

    - If $L<1$ we have
    $$
    \lim_{n \to\infty} a_{n}=0 \,.
    $$

    - If $L>1$, the sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ is unbounded, and hence does not converge.

2. Suppose that there exists $N \in \N$ and $L>1$ such that
$$
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| \geq L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,. 
$$
Then the sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ is unbounded, and hence does not converge.

:::



::: Proof

Define the sequence $b_{n}=\left|a_{n}\right|$. Then,

$$
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|=\frac{\left|a_{n+1}\right|}{\left|a_{n}\right|}=\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_{n}}
$$


*Part 1.* Suppose that there exists the limit
$$
L:=\lim_{n \to \infty}\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{b_{n+1}}{b_{n}} = L \,.
$${#eq-ratio-test-proof}

- $L<1$: Choose $r>0$ such that

L<r<1 \,.

$$
\e := r-L

By the convergence at (@eq-ratio-test-proof) there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\left|\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_{n}}-L\right| < \e = r - L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
In particular 
$$
\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_{n}}-L < r-L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,

which implies 
$$
b_{n+1} <  r \,{b_{n}} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-ratio-test-proof-1}
Let $n \geq N$, we can use (@eq-ratio-test-proof-1) recursively and obtain
$$
0 \leq b_{n} < \, r b_{n-1} < \ldots < r^{n-N} \, b_{N} = r^{n} \, \frac{b_{N}}{r^{N}} \,.
$$
In particular, we have proven that
$$
0 \leq b_{n} < r^{n} \, \frac{b_{N}}{r^{N}} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-ratio-test-proof-2}
Since $|r|<1$, by the Geometric Sequence Test Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-sequence} we infer
$$
r^{n} \rightarrow 0 \,.
$$
The Algebra of Limits the yields
$$
r^{n} \, \frac{b_{N}}{r^{N}} \rightarrow 0 \,.
$$
By the Squeeze Theorem \ref{theorem-squeeze} applied to (@eq-ratio-test-proof-2), it follows that 
$$   
b_{n} = |a_n| \to 0 \,.
$$
Since 
$$
-\left|a_{n}\right| \leq a_{n} \leq\left|a_{n}\right| \,,
$$
and 
$$
-|a_n| \to 0 \,, \quad |a_n| \to 0 \,, 
$$
we can again apply the Squeeze Theorem \ref{theorem-squeeze} to infer
$$
a_{n} \rightarrow 0 \,.

- $L>1$: Choose $r>0$ such that

1<r<L  \,.
$$
Define
$$

By the convergence (@eq-ratio-test-proof), there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\left|\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_{n}}-L\right| < \e = L - r \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
In particular,
$$
-(L-r) < \frac{b_{n+1}}{b_{n}}-L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
which implies
$$
b_{n+1} > r \, b_{n} \,, \quad  \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-ratio-test-proof-4}
Let $n \geq N$. Applying (@eq-ratio-test-proof-4) recursively we get

b_{n} > r^{n-N} \, b_{N} = r^{n} \, \frac{b_{N}}{r^{N}} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-ratio-test-proof-5}
Since $|r|>1$, by the Geometric Sequence Test we have that the sequence
$$
(r^n)
$$
is unbounded. Therefore also the right hand side of (@eq-ratio-test-proof-5) is unbounded, proving that $(b_n)$ is unbounded. Since
$$
b_n = |a_n|\,,
$$
we conclude that $(a_n)$ is unbounded. By Corollary \ref{corollary-convergent-bounded} we conclude that $(a_n)$ does not converge.


*Part 2.* Suppose that there exists $N \in \N$ and $L>1$ such that
$$
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| \geq L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,. 
$$
Since $b_n = |a_n|$, we infer
$$
b_{n+1} \geq L \, b_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,. 
$$
Arguing as above, we obtain
$$
b_n \geq L^n \, \frac{b_N}{L^N} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $L>1$, we have that the sequence 
$$  
L^n \, \frac{b_N}{L^N}
$$
is unbounded, by the Geometric Sequence Test. Hence also $(b_n)$ is unbounded, from which we conclude that $(a_n)$ is unbounded. By Corollary \ref{corollary-convergent-bounded} we conclude that $(a_n)$ does not converge.


:::


Let us apply the Ratio Test to some concrete examples.



::: Example

**Question.** Let 
$$
a_{n}=\frac{3^{n}}{n !} \,,
$$
where we recall that $n!$ (pronounced $n$ factorial) is defined by
$$
n! := n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot  \ldots \cdot  3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \,. 
$$
Prove that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n  = 0 \,.
$$

**Solution.** We have
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| & = \dfrac{\left( \dfrac{3^{n+1}}{(n+1) !} \right) }{  \left( \dfrac{3^{n}}{n !} \right) } \\
& = \frac{3^{n+1}}{3^{n}} \, \frac{n !}{(n+1) !} \\
& = \frac{3 \cdot 3^n}{3^n} \, \frac{n!}{(n+1) n!} \\
& =\frac{3}{n+1} \longrightarrow L = 0 \,.
\end{align*}
Hence, $L=0<1$ so $a_{n} \to 0$ by the Ratio Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-ratio-test}.

:::


::: Example

**Question.** Consider the sequence
$$
a_{n}=\frac{n ! \cdot 3^{n}}{\sqrt{(2 n) !}} \,.
$$
Prove that $(a_n)$ is divergent.

**Solution.** We have
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| & =\frac{(n+1) ! \cdot 3^{n+1}}{\sqrt{(2(n+1)) !}}  \frac{\sqrt{(2 n) !}}{n ! \cdot 3^{n}} \\
& =\frac{(n+1) !}{n !} \cdot \frac{3^{n+1}}{3^{n}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{(2 n) !}}{\sqrt{(2(n+1)) !}}
\end{align*}
For the first two fractions we have
$$
\frac{(n+1) !}{n !} \cdot \frac{3^{n+1}}{3^{n}} = 3(n+1) \,,
$$
while for the third fraction
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sqrt{(2 n) !}}{\sqrt{(2(n+1)) !}} & =\sqrt{\frac{(2 n) !}{(2 n+2) !}} \\
& = \sqrt{\frac{ (2n)! }{ (2n+2) \cdot (2n+1) \cdot (2n)! }} \\
& = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2 n+1)(2 n+2)}} \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore, using the Algebra of Limits,
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| & = \frac{3(n+1)}{\sqrt{(2 n+1)(2 n+2)}}\\
& = \frac{3n \left(1+ \dfrac{1}{n} \right)}{\sqrt{n^2 \left( 2 + \dfrac{1}{n}\right) \left(2 + \dfrac{2}{n} \right)}} \\
& = \frac{3 \left(1+ \dfrac{1}{n} \right)}{\sqrt{ \left( 2 + \dfrac{1}{n}\right) \left(2 + \dfrac{2}{n} \right)}}  \longrightarrow \frac{3}{\sqrt{4}} = \frac{3}{2} > 1 \,.
\end{align*}
By the Ratio Test we conclude that $(a_n)$ is divergent.

:::



::: Example 

**Question.** Prove that the following sequence is divergent
$$
a_{n}=\frac{n !}{100^{n}} \,.
$$


**Solution.** We have
$$
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| 
= \frac{100^{n}}{100^{n+1}} \frac{(n+1) !}{n !}
=\frac{n+1}{100} \,.
$$
Choose $N=101$. Then for all $n \geq N$,
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| 
& = \frac{n+1}{100} \\
& \geq \frac{N+1}{100} \\
& = \frac{101}{100} > 1 \,.
\end{align*}
Hence $a_{n}$ is divergent by the Ratio Test.

:::




::: Warning

The Ratio Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-ratio-test} does not address the case
$$
L=1 \,.
$$
This is because, in this case, the sequence $(a_n)$ 
might converge or diverge. 

For example:

- Define the sequence
$$
a_n = \frac1n \,.
$$
We have
$$
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| = \frac{n}{n+1} \rightarrow L = 1 \,. 
$$
Hence we cannot apply the Ratio Test. However we know that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, \frac1n = 0 \,.
$$


- Consider the sequence
$$
a_n = n \,.
$$
We have
$$
\frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|} = \frac{n+1}{n} \rightarrow L = 1 \,. 
$$
Hence we cannot apply the Ratio Test. However we know that $(a_n)$ is unbounded, and thus divergent.

:::



If the sequence $(a_n)$ is geometric, the Ratio Test of Theorem \ref{theorem-ratio-test} will give the same
answer as the Geometric Sequence Test of Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-sequence}. This is the content of the following remark.


::: Remark

Let $x \in \R$ and define the geometric sequence 
$$
a_{n}=x^{n} \,.
$$
Then
$$
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|  = \frac{\left|x^{n+1}\right|}{\left|x^{n}\right|} 
= \frac{|x|^{n+1}}{|x|^{n}} 
 =|x| \rightarrow |x| \,.
$$
Hence: 

- If $|x|<1$, the sequence $(a_n)$ converges by the Ratio Test
- If $|x|>1$, the sequence $(a_n)$ diverges by the Ratio Test. 
- If $|x|=1$, the sequence $(a_n)$ might be convergent or divergent.

These results are in agreement with the Geometric Sequence Test.

## Monotone sequences


We have seen in Theorem \ref{theorem-convergent-bounded} that convergent sequences are bounded. We noted that the converse statement is not true. 
For example the sequence
$$
a_n = (-1)^n
$$
is bounded but not convergent, as shown in Theorem \ref{theorem-1-minus-n}.
On the other hand, if a bounded sequence is **monotone**, then it is convergent.


::: Definition
### Monotone sequence

Let $(a_n)$ be a real sequence. We say that:

1. $(a_n)$ is **increasing** if 
$$
a_n \leq a_{n+1} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$

2. $(a_n)$ is **decreasing** if 
$$
a_n \geq a_{n+1} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$

3. $(a_n)$ is **monotone** if it is either increasing or decreasing.

:::



::: Example

**Question.** Prove that the following sequence is increasing
$$
a_n = \frac{n-1}{n} \,.
$$

**Solution.** We have
$$
a_{n+1} = \frac{n}{n+1} > \frac{n-1}{n} = a_n \,,
$$
where the inequality holds because
\begin{align*}
\frac{n}{n+1} > \frac{n-1}{n} \quad & \iff \quad 
n^2 > (n-1)(n+1) \quad  \\
& \iff \quad n^2 > n^2 - 1 \\
& \iff \quad 0 >  - 1
\end{align*}

The main result about monotone sequences is the Monotone Convergence
Theorem.


::: Theorem
### Monotone Convergence Theorem  {#theorem-monotone-convergence}

Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence in $\R$. Suppose that $(a_n)$ is bounded and
monotone. Then $(a_n)$ converges.

:::


::: Proof

Assume $(a_n)$ is bounded and monotone. Since $(a_n)$ is bounded, the set 
$$
A:=\{ a_n \divider n \in \N \}  \subseteq \R 
$$
is bounded below and above. By the Axiom of Completeness of $\R$ there exist $i,s \in \R$ such that
$$
i = \inf A \,, \quad s = \sup A \,.
$$

We have two cases:

1. $(a_n)$ is increasing: We are going to prove that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = s \,.
$$
Equivalently, we need to prove that
$$
\forall \, \e>0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st \forall \, n \geq N \,, \,\,
|a_n - s| < \e \,. 
$${#eq-monotone-conv-proof}
Let $\e > 0$. Since $s$ is the smallest upper bound for $A$, this means
$$
s - \e
$$
is not an upper bound. Therefore there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
s - \e < a_N \,.
$${#eq-monotone-convergence-proof-1}
Let $n \geq N$. Since $a_n$ is increasing, we have
$$
a_N \leq a_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-monotone-convergence-proof-2}
Moreover $s$ is the supremum of $A$, so that
$$
a_n \leq s < s + \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-monotone-convergence-proof-3}
Putting together estimates (@eq-monotone-convergence-proof-1)-(@eq-monotone-convergence-proof-2)-(@eq-monotone-convergence-proof-3)
we get
$$
s - \e < a_N \leq a_n \leq s < s + \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
The above implies 
$$
s - \e < a_n < s + \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
which is equivalent to (@eq-monotone-conv-proof).




2. $(a_n)$ is decreasing: With a similar proof, one can show that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = i \,.
$$
This is left as an exercise.

### Example: Euler's Number


As an application of the Monotone Convergence Theorem we can give
a formal definition for the Euler's Number
$$
e = 2.71828182845904523536 \dots
$$


::: {.Theorem #theorem-euler-number}

Consider the sequence
$$
a_n = \left(  1 + \frac{1}{n}  \right)^n  \,.
$$

We have that:

1. $(a_n)$ is monotone increasing,
2. $(a_n)$ is bounded.

In particular $(a_n)$ is convergent.

:::



::: Proof


*Part 1.* We prove that $(a_n)$ is increasing
$$
a_{n} \geq a_{n-1} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
which by definition is equivalent to
$$
\left(  1 + \frac{1}{n}  \right)^n \geq 
\left(  1 + \frac{1}{n - 1}  \right)^{n-1} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Summing the fractions we get
$$
\left(  \frac{n+1}{n}  \right)^n \geq 
\left(  \frac{n}{n-1}  \right)^{n-1} \,.  
$$
Multiplying by $((n-1)/n)^n$ we obtain
$$
\left(  \frac{n-1}{n}  \right)^n  \left(  \frac{n+1}{n}  \right)^n  \geq 
 \frac{n-1}{n}  \,,
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\left(  1 - \frac{1}{n^2}  \right)^n \geq 1 - \frac1n \,, \quad  \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-proof-euler-1}
Therefore $(a_n)$ is increasing if and only if (@eq-proof-euler-1) holds.
Recall Bernoulli's inequality from Lemma \ref{lemma-bernoulli}: For
$x \in \R$, $x>-1$, it holds
$$
(1 + x )^n  \geq 1 + nx  \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Appliying Bernoulli's inequality with 
$$
x = -\frac{1}{n^2}
$$
yields
$$
\left(  1 - \frac{1}{n^2}  \right)^n  \geq 1 + n \left( -\frac{1}{n^2} \right) = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \,,
$$
which is exactly (@eq-proof-euler-1). Then $(a_n)$ is increasing.



*Part 2*. We have to prove that $(a_n)$ is bounded, that is, that there
exists $M > 0$ such that
$$
|a_n| \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
To this end, introduce the sequence $(b_n)$ by setting
$$
b_n := \left(   1  + \frac1n \right)^{n+1} \,.
$$
The sequence $(b_n)$ is decreasing.

> To prove $(b_n)$ is decreasing, we need to show that 
$$
b_{n-1} \geq b_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,. 
$$
By definition of $b_n$, the above reads
$$
\left(   1  + \frac{1}{n-1} \right)^{n} \geq
\left(   1  + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n+1} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Summing the terms inside the brackets, the above is equivalent to
$$
\left(   \frac{n}{n-1} \right)^{n} \geq
\left(   \frac{n+1}{n} \right)^{n} \left(   \frac{n+1}{n} \right) \,.
$$
Multiplying  by $(n/(n+1))^n$ we get
$$
\left(  \frac{n^2}{n^2 - 1} \right)^{n} \geq  \left(   \frac{n+1}{n} \right) \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to
$$
\left( 1 +  \frac{1}{n^2 - 1} \right)^{n} \geq  \left(  1 + \frac{1}{n} \right) \,.
$${#eq-proof-euler-3}
Therefore $(b_n)$ is decreasing if and only if (@eq-proof-euler-3) holds for all $n \in \N$.
By choosing 
$$
x = \frac{1}{n^2 - 1} 
$$
in Bernoulli's inequality, we obtain
\begin{align*}
\left( 1 +  \frac{1}{n^2 - 1} \right)^{n} & \geq 1 + n \left(  \frac{1}{n^2 - 1}   \right) \\
& = 1 + \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \\
& \geq 1 + \frac1n \,,
\end{align*}
where in the last inequality we used that 
$$
 \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} > \frac1n \,,
$$
which holds, being equivalent to $n^2 > n^2 - 1$. We have therefore proven
(@eq-proof-euler-3), and hence $(b_n)$ is decreasing.


We now observe that
For all $n \in \N$
\begin{align*}
b_n & = \left(   1  + \frac1n \right)^{n+1} \\
    & = \left(   1  + \frac1n \right)^n \left(   1  + \frac1n \right) \\ 
    & = a_n \left(   1  + \frac1n \right) \\
    & > a_n \,.
\end{align*}
Since $(a_n)$ is increasing and $(b_n)$ is decreasing, in particular
$$
a_n \geq a_1 \,, \quad b_n \leq b_1 \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
a_1 \leq a_n < b_n \leq b_1 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
We compute
$$
a_1 = 2 \,, \quad b_1 = 4 \,,
$$
from which we get 
$$
2 \leq a_n \leq 4 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
|a_n| \leq 4 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
showing that $(a_n)$ is bounded.


*Part 3.* The sequence $(a_n)$ is increasing and bounded above. Therefore $(a_n)$ is convergent by the Monotone Convergence Theorem \ref{theorem-monotone-convergence}.

:::




Thanks to Theorem \ref{theorem-euler-number} we can define the Euler's Number $e$.


::: Definition
### Euler's Number

The Euler's number is defined as
$$
e := \lim_{n \to \infty } \, \left(  1 + \frac{1}{n}  \right)^n \,.
$$

Setting $n=1000$ in the formula for $(a_n)$, we get an approximation of $e$:
$$
e \approx a_{1000} = 2.7169 \,.

## Some important limits



In this section we investigate limits of some sequences to which 
the Limit Tests do not apply.


::: Theorem

Let $x \in \R$, with $x > 0$. Then
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{x} = 1 \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

*Step 1.* Assume $x \geq 1$. In this case
$$
\sqrt[n]{x} \geq 1 \,.
$$
Define 
$$
b_n := \sqrt[n]{x} - 1 \,,
$$
so that $b_n \geq 0$. By Bernoulli's Inequality we have
$$
x = (1 + b_n)^n \geq 1 + n b_n \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
0 \leq b_n \leq \frac{x-1}{n} \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\frac{x-1}{n} \longrightarrow 0 \,,
$$
by the Squeeze Theorem we infer $b_n \to 0$, and hence 
$$
\sqrt[n]{x} = 1 + b_n \longrightarrow 1 + 0 = 1\,, 
$$
by the Algebra of Limits.

*Step 2.* Assume $0< x < 1$. In this case
$$
\frac{1}{x} > 1 \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, \sqrt[n]{  1/x  } = 1  \,.
$$
by Step 1. Therefore
$$
\sqrt[n]{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{  1/x  }} \longrightarrow \frac{1}{1} = 1\,,
$$
by the Algebra of Limits.

::: {.Theorem   #theorem-important-limit-1}

Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence such that $a_n \to 0$. Then
$$
\sin(a_n) \to 0 \,, \quad 
\cos(a_n) \to 1 \,.
$$

:::

::: Proof

Assume that $a_n \to 0$ and set
$$
\e := \frac{\pi}{2} \,.
$$
By the convergence $a_m \to 0$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
|a_n| < \e = \frac{\pi}{2} \, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-limiti-notevoli-1}


*Step 1*. We prove that 
$$
\sin(a_n) \to 0 \,.
$$
By elementary trigonometry we have
$$
0 \leq |\sin (x)| = \sin |x| \leq |x| \,, \quad \forall  \, x \in \left[
-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \,.
$$
Therefore, since (@eq-limiti-notevoli-1) holds, we can substitute $x=a_n$ in the above inequality to get
$$
0 \leq |\sin (a_n)|  \leq |a_n| \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq \N \,.
$$
Since $a_n \to 0$, we also have $|a_n|\to 0$. Therefore 
$|\sin (a_n)| \to 0$ by the Squeeze Theorem. This immediately implies 
$\sin(a_n) \to 0$.

*Step 2*. We prove that 
$$
\cos(a_n) \to 1 \,.
$$
Inverting the relation
$$
\cos^2(x) + \sin^2 (x) = 1 \,,
$$
we obtain
$$
\cos(x) = \pm \sqrt{ 1 - \sin^2 (x) } \,.
$$
We have that $\cos(x) \geq 0$ for $-\pi/2 \leq x \leq \pi/2$. Thus
$$
\cos(x) = \sqrt{ 1 - \sin^2 (x) } \,, \quad \forall \, x \in 
\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \,.
$$
Since (@eq-limiti-notevoli-1) holds, we can set $x=a_n$ in the above inequality and obtain
$$
\cos(a_n) = \sqrt{ 1 - \sin^2 (a_n) } \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,. 
$$
By Step 1 we know that $\sin(a_n) \to 0$. Therefore, by the Algebra of Limits,
$$
 1 - \sin^2 (a_n) \longrightarrow 1 - 0 \cdot 0 = 1 \,.
$$
Using Theorem \ref{theorem-square-root-limit} we have
$$
\cos(a_n) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 (a_n)} \longrightarrow \sqrt{1} = 1 \,,
$$
concluding the proof.


:::



::: {.Theorem  #theorem-important-limit-2}

Suppose $(a_n)$ is such that $a_n \to 0$ and 
$$
a_n \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \, .
$$
Then
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sin(a_n)}{a_n} = 1 \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

The following elementary trigonometric inequality holds:
$$
\sin (x) < x < \tan (x) \,, \quad \forall \, x \in \left[0 ,\frac{\pi}{2} \right]  \,.
$$
Note that $\sin x >0$ for $0 < x < \pi/2$. Therefore we can divide the
above inequality by $\sin(x)$ and take the reciprocals to get
$$
\cos(x) < \frac{\sin (x)}{x} < 1 \,, \quad \forall \, x \in \Big( 0 ,\frac{\pi}{2} \Big] \,.
$$
If $-\pi/2<x<0$, we can apply the above inequality to $-x$ to obtain
$$
\cos(-x) < \frac{\sin(-x)}{-x} < 1  \,.
$$
Recalling that $\cos(-x) = \cos(x)$ and $\sin(-x)=-\sin(x)$, we get
$$
\cos(x) < \frac{\sin(x)}{x} < 1  \,, \quad \forall \, x \in \Big( -\frac{\pi}{2}, 0 \Big] \,.
$$
Thus
$$
\cos(x) < \frac{\sin(x)}{x} < 1  \,, \quad \forall  \, x \in \left[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \smallsetminus \{0\} \,.
$${#eq-limiti-notevoli-3}
Let 
$$
\e := \frac{\pi}{2} \,.
$$
Since $a_n \to 0$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
|a_n| < \e = \frac{\pi}{2} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $a_n \neq 0$ by assumption, the above shows that
$$
a_n \in \Big[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}  \Big] \smallsetminus \{0\} \,, 
\quad \forall \, n \geq \N \,.
$$
Therefore we can substitute $x=a_n$ into (@eq-limiti-notevoli-3) to get
$$
\cos(a_n) < \frac{\sin(a_n)}{a_n} < 1  \,, \quad \forall  \, n \geq N \,.
$$
We have
$$
\cos(a_n) \to 1
$$ 
by Theorem \ref{theorem-important-limit-1}. By the Squeeze Theorem we conclude that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sin(a_n)}{a_n} = 1 \,.
$$

:::



::: Warning

You might be tempted to apply L'Hôpital's rule (which we did not cover in these Lecture Notes) to compute 
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}  \,.
$$
This would yield the correct limit
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} =
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{(\sin(x))'}{(x)'} = 
\lim_{x \to 0} \cos(x) = 1  \,.
$$
However this is a circular argument, since the derivative of 
$\sin(x)$ at $x=0$ is defined as the limit
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \,.
