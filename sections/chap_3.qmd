# Real Numbers


In this chapter we introduce the system of Real Numbers $\R$ and study some of its properties. We will follow quite an abstract approach, which requires the
definition of ordered field. The fact that $\R$ is a continuum with no gaps (unlike $\Q$) will be consequence of the Axiom of Completeness. 

Therefore $\R$ will be defined as an ordered field in which the Axiom of Completeness holds.


## Fields

In order to introduce $\R$, we need the concepts of **binary operation** and **field**. We proceed in a general setting, starting from a set $K$. We will assume that there is an **equivalence relation** on $K$ denoted by $=$. 


::: Definition
### Binary operation
A binary operation on a set $K$ is a function 
$$
\circ \ \colon K \times K \to K
$$
which maps the ordered pair $(x,y)$ into $x \circ y$.
:::


::: Notation
We use the special symbols of $+$ and $\cdot$ to refer to addition and multiplication.

- **Addition**: The addition, or **sum** of $x,y \in K$ is denoted by 
$$
x + y 
$$
- **Multiplication**: The multiplication, or **product** of $x,y \in K$ is denoted by 
$$
x \cdot y \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, xy
$$
:::


::: Warning

When we talk about $+$ and $\cdot$ in a set $K$ we are **not necessarily** thinking
about the usual sum and multiplication in $\Q$. This is the case in the next Example, where we define 
$$
1 + 1 = 0
$$

:::


::: Example
### of binary operation  {#example-binary-operation}

Let $K=\{0,1\}$. We can for example define operations of sum and product on $K$ according to the tables 
$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 + & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}	
\qquad \qquad
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\cdot & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
    0 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
$$
The above mean that 
$$
\begin{gathered}
0+0 = 1+1 = 0 \,, \quad 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 1\,, \\
0 \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \,, \quad 1 \cdot 1 = 1  \,.
\end{gathered}
$${#eq-ktwo}

Note that we have defined (rather controversially!)
$$
1+1 = 0 
$$
The other option would have been to define
$$
1 + 1 = 1
$$
This would have been absolutely fine. However we could not have defined 
$$
1 + 1  = 2
$$
because $2 \notin K$.

**Note:** The operations in (@eq-ktwo) look more natural if you identify $0$ with the even numbers and $1$ with the odd numbers. In that case $1+1 = 0$ reads
$$
\mathrm{Odd} + \mathrm{Odd} = \mathrm{Even}
$$
Indeed all the definitions given in (@eq-ktwo) agree with such identification, see tables below:
$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 + & \mathrm{Even} & \mathrm{Odd} \\ \hline
 \mathrm{Even} & \mathrm{Even} & \mathrm{Odd} \\
 \mathrm{Odd} & \mathrm{Odd} & \mathrm{Even} \\
\end{array}	
\qquad \qquad
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\cdot & \mathrm{Even} & \mathrm{Odd} \\ \hline
    \mathrm{Even} & \mathrm{Even} & \mathrm{Even} \\
    \mathrm{Odd} & \mathrm{Even} & \mathrm{Odd} \\
\end{array}
$$


:::

Binary operations take ordered pairs of elements of $K$ as input. Therefore the operation
$$
x \circ y \circ z
$$
does not make sense, since we do not know which one between
$$
x \circ y  \quad \mbox{ or } \quad y \circ z
$$
has to be performed first. Moreover the outcome of an operation depends on order:
$$
x \circ y \neq y \circ x \,.
$$
This motivates the following definition. 


::: Definition
Let $K$ be a set and $\circ \ \colon K \times K \to K$ be a binary operation on $K$. We say that:

1. $\circ$ is **commutative** if 
    $$
    x \circ y = y \circ x \,, \quad \, \forall \, x,y \in K
    $$
2. $\circ$ is **associative** if 
    $$
    (x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z) \,, \quad \, \forall \, x,y,z \in K
    $$
3. An element $e \in K$ is called **neutral element** of $\circ$ if
    $$ 
    x \circ e = e \circ x = x \,, \quad \, \forall \, x \in K
    $$
4. Let $e$ be a neutral element of $\circ$ and let $x \in K$. An element $y \in K$ is called an **inverse** of $x$ with respect to $\circ$ if 
$$
x \circ y = y \circ x = e \,.
$$
:::



::: Example

Consider $\Q$ with the usual operations of sum and multiplication

- We already know that $+$ and $\cdot$ are commutative and associative

- The neutral element of the sum is $e = 0$

- The neutral element of the product is $e = 1$

- The additive inverse of $x$ is $-x$

- The multiplicative inverse of $x \neq 0$ is $1/x$.

:::



::: {.Example #example-binary-operation-2}

Let $K$ with $+$ and $\cdot$ be as in Example \ref{example-binary-operation}. The sum satisfies:

- $+$ is commutative, since 
$$
0 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 0 \,.  
$$
- $+$ is associative, since for example 
$$
(0 + 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 0 \,, \quad 0 + (1 + 1) = 0 + 0 = 0 \,,  
$$
and therefore 
$$
(0 + 1) + 1 = 0 + (1 + 1) \,.
$$
In general one can show that $+$ is associative by checking all the other permutations. 
- The neutral element of $+$ is $0$, since 
$$
0 + 0 = 0 \,, \quad 1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1 \,.
$$
- Every element has an inverse. Indeed, the inverse of $0$ is $0$, since 
$$
0 + 0 = 0\,,
$$
while the inverse of $1$ is $1$, since
$$
1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 0 \,.
$$

The multiplication satisfies:

- $\cdot$ is commutative, since 
$$
1 \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \,.
$$
- $\cdot$ is associative, since for example 
$$
(0 \cdot 1) \cdot 1 = 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \,, \quad 0 \cdot (1 \cdot 1) = 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \,,  
$$
and therefore 
$$
(0 \cdot 1) \cdot 1 = 0 \cdot (1 \cdot 1) \,.
$$
By checking all the other permutations one can show that $\cdot$ is associative.
- The neutral element of $\cdot$ is $1$, since 
$$
0 \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \,, \quad 1 \cdot 1 =  1 \,.
$$
- The element $0$ has no inverse, since  
$$
0 \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 0 = 0\,,
$$
and thus we never obtain the neutral element $1$. The inverse of $1$ is given by $1$, since 
$$
1 \cdot 1 = 1 \,.
$$
:::

::: Example

**Question.** Let $K=\{0,1\}$ be a set with binary operation $\circ$ defined by the table
$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 \circ & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
 0     & 1 & 1 \\
 1     & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}	
$$

1. Is $\circ$ commutative? Justify your answer.

2. Is $\circ$ associative? Justify your answer.

**Solution.**

1. We have
$$
0 \circ 1 = 1 \, , \quad 1 \circ 0 = 0
$$
and therefore
$$
0 \circ 1 \neq 1 \circ 0 \,.
$$
showing that $\circ$ is not commutative.

2. We have
$$
(0 \circ 1) \circ 1 = 1 \circ 1 = 0 \,,
$$
while 
$$
0 \circ (1 \circ 1) = 0 \circ 0 = 1 \,,
$$
so that 
$$
(0 \circ 1) \circ 1  \neq 0 \circ (1 \circ 1)\,.
$$
Thus, $\circ$ is not associative.

:::


We are ready to define fields.





::: Definition
### Field

Let $K$ be a set with binary operations of **addition** 
$$
+\ \colon K \times K \to K \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x + y 
$$
and **multiplication** 
$$
\cdot\ \colon K \times K \to K \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x \cdot y  = xy \,. 
$$ 
We call the triple $(K, + , \cdot)$ a **field** if:

1. The addition $+$ satisfies: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in K$
    - (A1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$
    x+y = y+x 
    $$
    $$
    (x+y)+z = x+(y+z) 
    $$
    - (A2) **Additive Identity**: There exists a **neutral element** in $K$ for $+$, which we call $0$. It holds:
    $$ 
    x + 0 = 0 + x = x 
    $$
    - (A3) **Additive Inverse**: There exists an **inverse** of $x$ with respect to $+$. We call this element the **additive inverse** of $x$ and denote it by $-x$. It holds
    $$
    x + (-x) = (-x) + x = 0 
    $$

2. The multiplication $\cdot$ satisifes: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in K$
    - (M1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$
    x \cdot y = y \cdot x 
    $$
    $$
    (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z) 
    $$
    - (M2) **Multiplicative Identity**: There exists a **neutral element** in $K$ for $\cdot$, which we call $1$. It holds:
    $$ 
    x \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot x = x 
    $$
    - (M3) **Multiplicative Inverse**: If $x \neq 0$ there exists an **inverse** of $x$ with respect to $\cdot$. We call this element the **multiplicative inverse** of $x$ and denote it by $x^{-1}$. It holds
    $$
    x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = 1 
    $$

3. The operations $+$ and $\cdot$ are related by 
    - (AM) **Distributive Property**: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in K$
    $$
    x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + (y \cdot z) \,.
    $$
:::




::: Example

$(\Q,+,\cdot)$ is a field, where $+$ and $\cdot$ are the usual operations of addition and multiplication. This is trivially true, as the field axioms clearly encode properties that $\Q$ already has.

:::

::: Remark 

Since fields are an abstract model for $\Q$, we have chosen to denote the two field operations with $+$ and $\cdot$. We could have denoted them with other symbols, e.g. $\clubsuit$ and $\heartsuit$. In this case (AM) would read
$$
x \, \clubsuit \, (y \, \heartsuit \, z) = (x \, \clubsuit \, y ) \,\heartsuit \, (y \, \clubsuit \, z )
$$
This would of course still make sense. It would just be a lot harder to write calculations and to remember which operation is which!

:::


::: Warning

It might be tempting to dismiss the definition of field, and to think that all fields look like $\Q$. This is not the case, as seen in the following Example.

:::



::: Example

**Question.** Let $K$ with $+$ and $\cdot$ be as in Example \ref{example-binary-operation}, that is, $K=\{0,1\}$ with operations defined by
$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 + & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}	
\qquad \qquad
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\cdot & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
    0 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
$$
Prove that $(K,+,\cdot)$ is a field. 

**Solution.** We have already shown in Example \ref{example-binary-operation-2} that: 

- (A1) and (M1) hold, 
- (A2) holds with neutral element $0$,
- (M2) holds with neutral element $1$,
- (A3) every element has an additive inverse, with
$$
-0 = 0 \,, \quad - 1 = 1 \,,
$$
- (M3) every element which is not $0$ a multiplicative inverse, with
$$
1^{-1} = 1\,.
$$

We are left to show the Distributive Property (AM). Indeed:

- (AM) For all $y,z \in K$ we have
$$
0 \cdot (y + z) = 0 \,, \quad (0 \cdot y) + (0 \cdot z) = 0 + 0 = 0\,,
$$
and also
$$
1 \cdot (y + z) = y + z \,, \quad (1 \cdot y) + (1 \cdot z) = y + z \,.
$$
Thus (AM) holds.
:::



::: Definition
### Subtraction and division
Let $(K,+,\cdot)$ be a field. We define:

1. **Subtraction** as the operation $-$ defined by 
$$
x - y := x + (-y) \,, \quad \forall \, x , y \in K \,,
$$
where $-y$ is the additive inverse of $y$.

2. **Division** as the operation $/$ defined by
$$
x/y := x \cdot y^{-1}\,, \quad \forall \, x , y \in K \,, \,\, y \neq 0 \,,
$$
where $y^{-1}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $y$.
:::


::: Warning

One might wonder why we are defining subtraction and division. Are they not already defined in $\Q$? Yes they are. But they make no sense in a general field $(K,+,\cdot)$, unless we define them explicitly. 

:::

Using the field axioms we can prove the following properties.

::: Proposition
### Uniqueness of neutral elements and inverses

Let $(K,+,\cdot)$ be a field. Then

1. There is a unique element in $K$ with the property of $0$,
2. There is a unique element in $K$ with the property of $1$,
3. For all $x \in K$ there is a unique additive inverse $-x$,
4. For all $x \in K$, $x \neq 0$, there is a unique multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$.
:::

::: Proof
1. Suppose that $0 \in K$ and $\widetilde{0} \in K$ are both neutral element of $+$, that is, they both satisfy (A2). Then 
$$
0 + \widetilde{0} = 0
$$
since $\widetilde{0}$ is a neutral element for $+$. Moreover
$$
\widetilde{0} + 0 = \widetilde{0}
$$
since $0$ is a neutral element for $+$. By commutativity of $+$, see property (A1), we have
$$
0 = 0 + \widetilde{0} = \widetilde{0} + 0 = \widetilde{0} \,,
$$
showing that $0 = \widetilde{0}$. Hence the neutral element for $+$ is unique.
2. Exercise.
3. Let $x \in K$ and suppose that $y, \widetilde{y} \in K$ are both additive inverses of $x$, that is, they both satisfy (A3). Therefore
$$
x + y = 0
$$
since $y$ is an additive inverse of $x$ and
$$
x + \widetilde{y} = 0 
$$
since $\widetilde{y}$ is an additive inverse of $x$. Therefore we can use commutativity and associativity and of $+$, see property (A1), and the fact that $0$ is the neutral element of $+$, to infer
\begin{align*}
y & = y + 0 = y + (x + \widetilde{y}) \\ 
  & = (y + x) + \widetilde{y} = (x + y) + \widetilde{y} \\
  & = 0 + \widetilde{y} = \widetilde{y} \,,    
\end{align*}
concluding that $y = \widetilde{y}$. Thus there is a unique additive inverse of $x$, and 
$$
y = \widetilde{y} = -x \,,
$$
with $-x$ the element from property (A3).
4. Exercise.
:::



Using the properties of field we can also show that the usual properties of sum, subtraction, multiplication and division still hold in any field. We list such properties in the following proposition.


::: Proposition
### Properties of field operations
Let $(K,+,\cdot)$ be a field. Then for all $x,y,z \in K$,

- $x + y = x + z \,\, \implies \,\, y = z$
- $x \cdot y = x \cdot z \,$ and $\,x \neq 0 \,\, \implies \,\, y = z$
- $- 0 = 0$
- $1^{-1} = 1$
- $x \cdot 0 = 0$
- $-1 \cdot x = -x$
- $-(-x) = x$
- $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x \,$ if $\, x \neq 0$
- $(x \cdot y)^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot y^{-1}$ 
:::




The above properties can be all proven with elementary use of the field properties (A1)-(A3), (M1)-(M3) and (AM). This is an exercise in patience, and is left to the reader.



Let us conclude with examining the sets of numbers introduced in @sec-chap-1. 

::: Theorem
Consider the sets $\N$, $\Z$, $\Q$ with the usual operations $+$ and $\cdot$. We have:

- $(\N, + , \cdot)$ is **not a field**:  
It satisfies properties (A1), (A2), (M1), (M2), (AM) of fields. It is missing properties (A3) and (M3), the additive and multiplicative inverse properties, respectively.
- $(\Z, + , \cdot)$ is **not a field**:  
It satisfies properties (A1), (A2), (A3), (M1), (M2), (AM) of fields. Thus it is only missing (M3), the multiplicative inverse property.
- $(\Q, + , \cdot)$ **is a field**.


:::

The proof is omitted. 




## Ordered fields

::: Definition
Let $K$ be a set with binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$, and with an order relation $\leq$. We call $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ an **ordered field** if:

1. $(K,+,\cdot)$ is a field

3. There $\leq$ is of **total order** on $K$:  $\, \forall \, x, y, z \in K$ 
    - (O1) **Reflexivity**: 
    $$
    x \leq x
    $$ 
    - (O2) **Antisymmetry**: 
    $$
    x \leq y \, \mbox{ and } \, y \leq x \,\, \implies \,\, x = y 
    $$
    - (O3) **Transitivity**: 
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, y \leq z \,\, \implies \,\, x = z 
    $$
    - (O4) **Total order**:  
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, y \leq x 
    $$

4. The operations $+$ and $\cdot$, and the total order $\leq$, are related by the following properties: $\, \forall x, y, z \in K$
    - (AM) **Distributive**: Relates addition and multiplication via
    $$
    x \cdot (y + z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z 
    $$
    - (AO) Relates addition and order with the requirement:
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \implies \,\, x + z \leq y + z
    $$
    - (MO) Relates multiplication and order with the requirement:
    $$
    x \geq 0, \, y \geq 0  \,\, \implies \,\, x \cdot y  \geq 0
    $$
:::


::: Example 
$(\Q,+,\cdot,\leq)$ is an **ordered field**.
:::



## Cut Property  

We have just introduced the notion of **fields** and **ordered fields**. We noted that the set of rational numbers with the usual operations of sum and multiplication
$$
(\Q, + , \cdot)
$$
is a field. Moreover it is an ordered field with the usual order $\leq$.

We now need to address the key issue we proved in @sec-chap-1, namely, the fact that
$$
\sqrt{2} \notin \Q \,.
$$
Intuitively, this means that $\Q$ has **gaps**, and cannot be represented as a **continuous** line. The rigorous definition of **lack of gaps** needs the concept of **cut** of a set. This, in turn, needs the concept of **partition**.



::: Definition
### Partition of a set

Let $S$ be a non-empty set. The pair $(A,B)$ is a **partition** of $S$ if
$$
A , B \subseteq S\,, \quad  A \neq \emptyset\,, \quad B \neq \emptyset \,,
$$
and
$$
S = A \cup B \,, \quad 
A \cap B = \emptyset \, . 
$$
:::



![Schematic picture of a partition $(A,B)$ of the set $K$.](/images/partition.png){width=55%}


::: Definition
### Cut of a set

Let $S$ be a non-empty set with a total order relation $\leq$. The pair $(A,B)$ is a **cut** of $S$ if 

1. $(A,B)$ is a **partition** of $S$,
2. We have
$$
a \leq b \,,  \quad \forall \, a \in A \,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$$
:::

The **cut** of a set is often called **Dedekind cut**, named after **Richard Dedekind**, who used cuts to give an explicit construction of the real numbers $\R$, see [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut).


::: Definition 
### Cut property
Let $S$ be a non-empty set with a total order relation $\leq$. We say that $S$ has the **cut property** if for every cut $(A,B)$ of $S$ there exists some $s \in S$ such that 
$$
a \leq s \leq b \,, \quad \forall  \, a \in A\,, \,\, \forall  \, b \in B \,.
$$
We call $s$ the **separator** of the cut $(A,B)$.
:::




::: Example
Let $S = \Q$ and consider the sets
$$
A = (-\infty,s] \cap \Q \,, \quad B = (s,\infty) \cap \Q \,. 
$$
for some $s \in \Q$. Then the pair $(A,B)$ is a cut of $\Q$, and $s$ is the separator.
:::


![$(A,B)$ is a cut of $\Q$ with separator $s$.](/images/cut.png){width=70%}


::: Question
Do all ordered fields have the Cut Property? Does $\Q$ have the Cut Property?
:::


The answer to the above question is **NO**. For example the pair
$$
A =  (-\infty,\sqrt{2}) \cap \Q \,, \quad B = (\sqrt{2},\infty) \cap \Q\,.
$${#eq-cut-Q}
is a cut of $\Q$, since $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$. However what is the separator? It should be $s = \sqrt{2}$, given that clearly 
$$
a \leq \sqrt{2}  \leq b \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A\,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$$
However $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$, so we are **NOT ALLOWED** to take it as separator. Indeed, we can show that $(A,B)$ defined as in (@eq-cut-Q) has no separator.



![$(A,B)$ is a cut of $\Q$ which has no separator](/images/cut_sqrt2.png){width=70%}







::: Theorem
### $\Q$ does not have the cut property.  {#theorem-Q-cut}

$\Q$ does not have the cut property. More explicitly, there exist a cut $(A,B)$ of $\Q$ which has no separator.
:::

::: Remark
### Ideas for the proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-Q-cut}    {#remark-idea-proof-cut}

Before proceeding with the proof, let us summarize the ideas behind it:  
We will consider the cut $(A,B)$ in (@eq-cut-Q). We then assume by contradiction that $(A,B)$ admits a separator $L \in \Q$, so that 
$$
a \leq L \leq b \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A\,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,. 
$${#eq-theorem-Q-cut}
Since $(A,B)$ is a partition of $\Q$, then either $L \in A$ or $L \in B$. These will both lead to a contradiction:

- If $L \in A$, by definition of $A$ we have
$$
L < \sqrt{2} \,.
$$
We want to contradict the fact that $L$ is a separator for the cut $(A,B)$. 
The idea is that, since $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$, it is possible to squeeze a rational number $\widetilde{L} \in \Q$ in between $L$ and $\sqrt{2}$, i.e.
$$
L < \widetilde{L} < \sqrt{2} \,.
$$
How do we find such $\widetilde{L}$ in practice? We look for a
number $\widetilde{L}_n$ of the form
$$
\widetilde{L}_n = L + \frac{1}{n}
$$
for some $n \in \N$ to be suitably chosen later. Clearly $\widetilde{L}_n \in \Q$ and
$$
L < \widetilde{L}_n 
$$
for all $n \in \N$. We will then be able to find $n_0 \in \N$ such that 
$$
L < \widetilde{L}_{n_0} < \sqrt{2} \,.
$${#eq-theorem-Q-cut-2} 
Now comes the contradiction: From (@eq-theorem-Q-cut-2) we see that $\widetilde{L}_{n_0} \in A$. However $L$ is 
a separator, and so from (@eq-theorem-Q-cut) we have
$$
\widetilde{L}_{n_0} \leq L \,,
$$
which contradicts (@eq-theorem-Q-cut-2).


- If $L \in B$, by definition of $B$ we have
$$
 \sqrt{2} < L \,.
$$
The idea is the same as above: Since $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$, we can squeeze a rational number $\widetilde{L} \in \Q$ between $\sqrt{2}$ and $L$, i.e.,
$$
\sqrt{2} < \widetilde{L} < L \,.
$$
Since we want $\widetilde{L}$ to be a rational number smaller than $L$, we look
for $\widetilde{L}$ of the form
$$
\widetilde{L}_n := L - \frac{1}{n} \,,
$$
for a suitable $n \in \N$. Clearly $\widetilde{L}_n \in \Q$ and
$$
\widetilde{L}_n < L \,,
$$
for all $n \in \N$. We will be able to find $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
\sqrt{2} < \widetilde{L}_{n_0} < L \,.
$${#eq-theorem-Q-cut-3}
Therefore $\widetilde{L}_{n_0} \in B$. Again, contradiction: $L$ is a separator and so
$$
L \leq \widetilde{L}_{n_0}  \,,
$$
which contradicts (@eq-theorem-Q-cut-3).


Both cases $L \in A$ or $L \in B$ lead to a contradiction. Since these are all the possibilities, we conclude that the cut $(A,B)$ has no separator in $\Q$.
:::


Time to make the ideas in the above remark rigorous. Two main issues need fixing:

1. $\sqrt{2}$ is just a symbol for a number $x$ such that $x^2 = 2$. As $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$, what is the meaning of the expression
$$
a < \sqrt{2} < b 
$$
when $a,b \in \Q$? We can only compare rational numbers with rational numbers, so the above inequalities are meaningless.  We need a more clever way to write down the sets $A$ and $B$ so that they make sense as objects in $\Q$.

2. We said it is possible to find $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
L < \widetilde{L}_{n_0} < \sqrt{2} \quad \text{ or } \quad \sqrt{2} < \widetilde{L}_{n_0} < L 
$$
We need to prove it!



::: Proof
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-Q-cut}
Let $A$ and $B$ be the sets defined in (@eq-cut-Q). It is useful to rewrite $A$ and $B$ in the form
$$
A = A_1 \cup A_2 \,, 
$$
where 
$$
A_1 = \{ q \in \Q \divider q< 0  \}\,, 
$$
$$
A_2 =\{ q \in \Q \divider q \geq 0\,, \,\, q^2 < 2  \} \,,
$$
and
$$
B = \{ q \in \Q \divider q > 0, \,\, q^2 > 2  \} \,.
$$

*Step 1. $(A,B)$ is a cut of $\Q$*:  
We need to prove the following:

1. $(A,B)$ is a partition of $\Q$. This is because $A , B \subseteq \Q$ with $A \neq \emptyset$ and $B \neq \emptyset$. Moreover 
$A \cap B = \emptyset$ and
$$
A \cup B = \Q\,,
$$ 
given that $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$, and so there is no element $q \in \Q$ such that $q^2 = 2$.
2. It holds
$$
a \leq b \,, \quad \forall a \in A \,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$$
Indeed, suppose that $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. We have two cases:
    - $a \in A_1$: Therefore $a<0$. In particular
    $$
    a < 0 < b\,,
    $$
    given that $b > 0$ for all $b \in B$. Thus $a<b$.
    - $a \in A_2$: Therefore $a \geq 0$ and $a^2 < 2$. In particular
    $$
    a^2 < 2 < b^2 \,,
    $$
    since $b^2>2$ for all $b \in B$. In particular 
    $$
    a^2 < b^2 \,.
    $$
    Since $b>0$ for all $b \in B$, from the above inequality we infer $a<b$, concluding.



*Step 2. $(A,B)$ has no separator*:  
Suppose by contradiction that $(A,B)$ admits a separator
$$
L \in \Q \,.
$$
By definition this means
$$
a \leq L \leq b \,, \quad \forall a \in A \,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction}
Since
$$
L \in \Q \,, \quad \Q = A \cup B \,, \quad  A \cap B = \emptyset \,,
$$
then either $L \in A$ or $L \in B$. We will see that both these possibilities lead to a contradiction:

*Case 1: $L \in A$.*  
By (@eq-separator-contradiction) we know that 
$$
a \leq L \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-hp-0}
In particular the above implies 
$$
L \geq 0
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-1}
since $0 \in A$. Therefore we must have $L \in A_2$, that is, 
$$
L \geq 0 \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, L^2 < 2 \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-hp-1}
Set 
$$
\widetilde{L} := L + \frac1n
$$
for $n \in \N$, $n \neq 0$ to be chosen later. Clearly we have
$$
\widetilde{L} \in \Q   \,\,\, \mbox{ and } \,\,\, L < \widetilde{L}  \,. 
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-2}
From (@eq-separator-contradiction-1) and (@eq-separator-contradiction-2) we have also
$$
\widetilde{L}>0 \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-3}
We now want to show that there is a choice of $n$ such that $\widetilde{L}^2 < 2$, which will lead to a contradiction. Indeed, we can estimate
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{L}^2 & = \left( L + \frac1n \right)^2 \\
            & = L^2 + \frac{1}{n^2} + 2 \frac{L}{n} \\
            & < L^2 + \frac{1}{n} + 2 \frac{L}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, \frac{1}{n}<\frac{1}{n^2}  \right) \\
            & = L^2 + \frac{2L + 1}{n} \,. 
\end{align*}
If we now impose that 
$$
L^2 + \frac{2L + 1}{n} < 2 \,,
$$
we can rearrange the above and obtain
$$
n(2 - L^2) > 2L + 1 \,.
$$
Now note that $L^2 < 2$ by assumption (@eq-separator-contradiction-hp-1). Thus we can divived by $(2 - L^2)$ and obtain
$$
n >\frac{2L + 1}{2 - L^2} \,.
$$
Therefore we have just shown that 
$$
n >\frac{2L + 1}{2 - L^2}  \,\, \implies \,\, \widetilde{L}^2 < 2 \,.
$$
Together with (@eq-separator-contradiction-3) this implies $\widetilde{L} \in A$. Therefore we have
$$
\widetilde{L} \leq L
$$
by (@eq-separator-contradiction-hp-0). On the other hand it also holds 
$$
\widetilde{L} > L
$$
by (@eq-separator-contradiction-2), and therefore we have a contradiction. Thus $L \notin A$.

*Case 2: $L \in B$.*  
As $L \in B$, we have by definition
$$
L > 0 \,, \quad L^2 > 2 \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-5}
Moreover since $L$ is a separator, see (@eq-separator-contradiction), in particular
$$
L \leq b \,,  \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-6}
Define now 
$$
\widetilde{L} := L - \frac1n
$$
with $n \in \N$, $n \neq 0$ to be chosen later. Clearly we have
$$
\widetilde{L} \in \Q \,, \quad \widetilde{L} < L \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-7}
We now show that $n$ can be chosen so that $\widetilde{L} \in B$. Indeed
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{L}^2  & = \left(  L - \frac1n   \right)^2 \\
             & = L^2 + \frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \frac{L}{n} \\
             & > L^2 - \frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \frac{L}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, \frac{1}{n^2} > - \frac{1}{n^2}  \right) \\
             & > L^2 - \frac{1}{n} - 2 \frac{L}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, -\frac{1}{n^2} > - \frac{1}{n}  \right) \\
             & = L^2 - \frac{1 + 2L}{n} \,.
\end{align*}
Now we impose 
$$
L^2 - \frac{1 + 2L}{n} > 2 
$$
which is equivalent to 
$$
n(L^2 - 2) > 1 + 2L \,.
$$
Since we are assuming $L \in B$, then $L^2 > 2$, see (@eq-separator-contradiction-5). Therefore we can divide by $(L^2 -2)$ and get
$$
n > \frac{1+2L}{L^2 - 2} \,.
$$
In total, we have just shown that 
$$
 n > \frac{1+2L}{L^2 - 2} \quad \implies \quad \widetilde{L}^2 > 2\,,
$$
proving that $\widetilde{L} \in B$. Therefore by (@eq-separator-contradiction-6) we get
$$
L \leq \widetilde{L} \,.
$$
This contradicts (@eq-separator-contradiction-7).

*Conclusion:*  
We have seen that assuming that $(A,B)$ has a separator $L \in \Q$ leads to a contradiction. Thus the cut $(A,B)$ has no separator.
:::


::: Remark

The above proof is also suggesting the following observations: 

- The set
$$
A = (-\infty, \sqrt{2}) \cap \Q
$$
does not admit a **largest** element in $\Q$

- The set
$$
B = (\sqrt{2}, \infty) \cap \Q
$$
does not admit a **lowest element** in $\Q$. 


It turns out that the **largest** and **lowest** element play a crucial role in analysis. We will give precise definitions in the next section.
:::



 
## Supremum and infimum


A crucial definition in Analysis is the one of supremum or infimum of a set. This is also another way of studying the **gaps** of $\Q$.


::: Example
### Intuition about supremum and infimum
Consider the set
$$
A = [0,1) \cap \Q \,.
$$
Intuitively, we understand that $A$ is bounded, i.e. not infinite. We also see that

- $0$ is the lowest element of $A$
- $1$ is the highest element of $A$

However we see that $0 \in A$ while $1 \notin A$. We will see that 

- $0$ can be defined as the **infimum** and **minimum** of $A$.
- $1$ can be defined as the **supremum**, but not **maximum**, of $A$. 
:::



### Upper bound, supremum, maximum 

We start by defining the supremum. First we need the notion of upper bound of a set. In the following we assume that $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ is an ordered field.


::: Definition
### Upper bound and bounded above

Let $A \subseteq K$:

1. We say that $b \in K$ is an **upper bound** for $A$ if
$$
a \leq b \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$$
2. We say that $A$ is **bounded above** if there exists and upper bound $b \in K$ for $A$.
:::




::: Definition 
### Supremum

Let $A \subseteq K$. A number $s \in K$ is called **least upper bound** or **supremum** of $A$ if:

i. $s$ is an upper bound for $A$,
ii. $s$ is the smallest upper bound of $A$, that is, 
    $$
    \mbox{If } \, b \in K \, \mbox{ is upper bound for } \, A \, \mbox{ then } \, s \leq b \,.  
    $$
:::

::: Notation
We will almost always prefer the name supremum to least upper bound. For $A \subseteq K$ the supremum is denoted by
$$
s := \sup \ A \,.
$$
:::


::: Remark
Note that if a set $A \subseteq K$ in **NOT** bounded above, then the supremum does not exist, as there are no upper bounds of $A$. 
:::


::: Proposition
### Uniqueness of sup {#proposition-sup-unique}

Let $A \subseteq K$. If 
$$
\sup A
$$
exists, then it is unique.  
:::


::: Proof
Suppose there exist $s_1, s_2 \in K$ such that
$$
s_1 = \sup A,  \,\, s_2 = \sup A \,.
$$
Then:

- Since $s_2 = \sup A$, in particular $s_2$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since $s_1 = \sup A$ then $s_1$ is the lowest upper bound. Thus we get
$$
s_1 \leq s_2 \,.
$$
- Exchanging the roles $s_1$ and $s_2$ in the above reasoning we also get
$$
s_2 \leq s_1 \,.
$$

This shows $s_1 = s_2$.
:::




::: Warning
It could happen that:

- A set can have infinite upper bounds,
- The supremum does not belong to the set.

For example
$$
A = [0,1)  \cap \Q
$$
has for upper bounds all the numbers $b \in \Q$ with $b>1$. Moreover one can show that 
$$
\sup A = 1\,,
$$
and so 
$$
\sup A \notin A \,.
$$
:::

::: Warning 
The supremum does not exist in general. For example let
$$
A = [0,\sqrt{2})  \cap \Q \,.
$$
We will show that $\sup A$ does not exist in $\Q$. Indeed we will have that
$$
\sup A = \sqrt{2} \in \R \,.
$$
:::


![Supremum and upper bounds of a set $A$ in the field $K$](/images/definition_supremum.png){width=70%}



::: Definition 
### Maximum
Let $A \subseteq K$. A number $M \in K$ is called the **maximum** of $A$ if:
$$
M \in A   \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, a \leq M  \,, \, \forall a \in A \,.
$$
We denote the maximum by
$$
M = \max A \,.
$$
:::



::: Proposition 
### Relationship between Max and Sup {#proposition-max-sup}

Let $A \subseteq K$. If the maximum of $A$ exists, then also the supremum exists, and
$$
\sup A = \max A \,.
$$
:::

::: Proof
Let 
$$
M = \max A \,.
$$ 
Then:

- By definition we have $M \in A$ and 
$$
a \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$$
In particular the above tells us that $M$ is an upper bound of $A$. 
- We claim that $M$ is the least upper bound. Indeed, suppose $b$ is an upper bound of $A$, that is,    
$$
a \leq b \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$$
In particular, since $M \in A$, by the above condition we have
$$
M \leq b \,.
$$

Therefore $M$ is the least upper bound of $A$, meaning that $M = \sup A$.
:::


::: Warning
The converse of the above statement is false: In general the $\sup$ might exist while the $\max$ does not. For example
$$
A = [0,1) \cap \Q
$$
is such that 
$$
\sup A = 1
$$
but $\max A$ does not exist. Instead for the set
$$
B = [0,1] \cap \Q
$$
we have that 
$$
\max A = \sup A = 1 \,. 
$$
:::






### Lower bound, infimum, minimum

We now introduce the definitions of lower bound, infimum, minimum. These are the counterpart of upper bound, supremum and maximum, respectively. In the following $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ is an ordered field. 




::: Definition
### Upper bound, bounded below, infimum, minimum

Let $A \subseteq K$:

1. We say that $l \in K$ is a **lower bound** for $A$ if
$$
l \leq a \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$$
2. We say that $A$ is **bounded below** if there exists a lower bound $l \in K$ for $A$.
3. We say that $i \in K$ is the **greatest lower bound** or **infimum** of $A$ if:

    - $i$ is a lower bound for $A$,
    - $i$ is the largest lower bound of $A$, that is, 
    $$
    \mbox{If } \, l \in K \, \mbox{ is a lower bound for } \, A \, \mbox{ then } \, l \leq i \,.  
    $$
If it exists, the infimum is denoted by 
$$
i = \inf A \,.
$$
4. We say that $m \in K$ is the **minimum** of $A$ if:
$$
m \in A   \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, m \leq a  \,, \, \forall a \in A \,.
$$
If it exists, we denote the minimum by
$$
m = \min A \,.
$$
:::



![Infimum and lower bounds of a set $A$ in the field $K$](/images/definition_infimum.png){width=70%}




::: Proposition
Let $A \subseteq K$:

1. If $\inf A$ exists, then it is unique.
2. If the minimum of $A$ exists, then also the infimum exists, and
$$
\inf A = \min A \,.
$$  

:::

The proof is similar to the ones of Propositions \ref{proposition-sup-unique} and \ref{proposition-max-sup}, and is left to the reader as an exercise.


::: Warning
It could happen that:

- A set has infinite lower bounds,
- The infimum does not belong to the set.

For example
$$
A = (0,1)  \cap \Q
$$
has for lower bounds all the numbers $b \in \Q$ with $b<1$. Moreover we will show that
$$
\inf A = 0\,,
$$
and so 
$$
\inf A \notin A \,.
$$
:::

::: Warning 
The infimum does not exist in general. For example let
$$
A = (\sqrt{2},5]  \cap \Q \,.
$$
We will show that $\inf A$ does not exist in $\Q$. Indeed we will have that
$$
\inf A = \sqrt{2} \in \R \,.
$$
:::


::: Warning
In general the $\inf$ might exist while the $\min$ does not. For example
$$
A = (0,1) \cap \Q
$$
is such that 
$$
\inf A = 0
$$
but $\min A$ does not exist. Instead for the set
$$
B = [0,1] \cap \Q
$$
we have that 
$$
\inf A = \min A = 0 \,.

:::




::: Proposition
Let $A \subseteq K$. If $\inf A$ and $\sup A$ exist, then
$$
\inf A \leq a \leq \sup A \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.

The proof is trivial, and is left as an exercise. We now have a complete picture about supremum and infimum, see @fig-inf-sup.



![Supremum, upper bounds, infimum and lower bounds of a set $A$ in $K$](/images/definition_sup_inf.png){#fig-inf-sup width=70%}

## Completeness

In this section $(K,+,\cdot, \leq)$ denotes an ordered field.

::: Question
Let $A \subseteq K$ be non-empty and bounded above. Does
$$
\sup A 
$$
always exist?
:::

The answer to the above question is **NO**. Like we did with the Cut Property, the counterexample can be found in the set of rational numbers $\Q$. A set bounded above for which the supremum does nor exist is, for example, 
$$
A = [0, \sqrt{2}) \cap \Q \,.
$${#eq-no-sup-in-Q}


::: {.Theorem  #theorem-Q-not-complete}
There exists a set $A \subseteq \Q$ such that 

- $A$ is non-empty,
- $A$ is bounded above,
- $\sup A$ does not exist in $\Q$. 
:::

The proof uses similar ideas to those employed in demonstrating that $\Q$ does not satisfy the Cut Property, see the proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-Q-cut}.

::: Proof
Define the set
$$
A = \{ q \in \Q  \divider q \geq 0 \,, \,\, q^2 < 2 \} \,.
$$
Notice that $A$ formally coincides with the set in (@eq-no-sup-in-Q).

*Step 1. $A$ is bounded above.*  
Take $b:=3$. Then $b$ is an upper bound for $A$. Indeed by definition 
$$
q^2 < 2 \,, \,\, q \geq 0 \,, \,\,\, \forall \, q \in A \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
q^2 < 2 < 9  \implies q^2 < 9 \implies q < 3 = b
$$
for each $q \in A$, showing that $b=3$ is an upper bound for $A$.

*Step 2. The supremum of $A$ does not exist in $\Q$.*  
Assume by contradiction that there exists
$$
s = \sup A \in \Q
$$
By definition it holds
$$
q \leq s \,, \quad \forall \, q \in A
$$ {#eq-sup-contradiction-1}
$$
q \leq b  \,, \, \forall \, q \in A \,\, \implies \,\, 
s \leq b 
$$ {#eq-sup-contradiction-2}
There are two possibilities: $s \in A$ or $s \notin A$.

*Case 1*.  If $s \in A$, by definition of $A$ we have
$$
s  \geq 0\,, \quad s^2 < 2 \,.
$${#eq-sup-contradiction-3}
Define 
$$
\widetilde{s} := s + \frac{1}{n}
$$
with $n \in \N$, $n \neq 0$ to be chosen later. Then
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{s}^2 & = \left( s + \frac1n \right)^2 \\
            & = s^2 + \frac{1}{n^2} + 2 \frac{s}{n} \\
            & < s^2 + \frac{1}{n} + 2 \frac{s}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, \frac{1}{n}<\frac{1}{n^2}  \right) \\
            & = s^2 + \frac{2s + 1}{n} \,. 
\end{align*}
If we now impose that 
$$
s^2 + \frac{2s + 1}{n} < 2 \,,
$$
we can rearrange the above and obtain
$$
n(2 - s^2) > 2s + 1 \,.
$$
Now note that $s^2 < 2$ by assumption (@eq-sup-contradiction-3). Thus we can divide by $(2 - s^2)$ and obtain
$$
n >\frac{2s + 1}{2 - s^2} \,.
$$
To summarize, we have just shown that 
$$
n >\frac{2s + 1}{2 - s^2}  \,\, \implies \,\, \widetilde{s}^2 < 2 \,.
$$
Moreover $\widetilde{s} := (s + 1/n) \in \Q$ and
$$
\tilde{s} > s \geq 0 \,,
$$
showing that
$$
\widetilde{s} \in A \,.
$$
Since $s = \sup A$, we then have
$$
\widetilde{s} \leq s \,.
$$
However 
$$
\widetilde{s} := s + \frac{1}{n} > s \,,
$$
yielding a contradiction. Thus $s \in A$ is not possible. 

*Case 2.* Assume $s \notin A$. Since $s = \sup A$ and $0 \in A$, we deduce that
$$
s>0 \,.
$$
In particular $s \notin A$ implies that
$$
s^2 > 2 \,.
$${#eq-sup-contradiction-4}  
Define 
$$
\widetilde{s} := s - \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$
We have
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{s}^2  & = \left(  s - \frac1n   \right)^2 \\
             & = s^2 + \frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \frac{s}{n} \\
             & > s^2 - \frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \frac{s}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, \frac{1}{n^2} > - \frac{1}{n^2}  \right) \\
             & > s^2 - \frac{1}{n} - 2 \frac{s}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, -\frac{1}{n^2} > - \frac{1}{n}  \right) \\
             & = s^2 - \frac{1 + 2s}{n} \,.
\end{align*}
Now we impose 
$$
s^2 - \frac{1 + 2s}{n} > 2 
$$
which is equivalent to 
$$
n(s^2 - 2) > 1 + 2s \,.
$$
By (@eq-sup-contradiction-4) we have $s^2 > 2$. Therefore we can divide by $(s^2 -2)$ and get
$$
n > \frac{1+2s}{s^2 - 2} \,.
$$
In summary, we have just shown that 
$$
 n > \frac{1+2s}{s^2 - 2} \quad \implies \quad \widetilde{s}^2 > 2\,.
$$
We also want to choose $n$ in such a way that
$$
\widetilde{s} > 0
$$
This means
$$
0 < \widetilde{s} = s - \frac1n \quad \iff \quad n > \frac{1}{s}
$$
Therefore 
$$
n > \min \left\{ \frac{1+2s}{s^2 - 2}, \frac1s  \right\} \quad \implies \quad \widetilde{s} > 0\,, \quad \widetilde{s}^2 > 2 
$$
In particular $\widetilde{s} \notin A$, and by definition of $A$ we have
$$
\widetilde{s} \geq q \,, \quad \forall \, q \in A\,.
$$

>Indeed, assume $\widetilde{s} < q$ for some $q \in A$. Since $\widetilde{s}>0$, we can take the squares and deduce that $\widetilde{s}^2<q^2<2$, which is a contradiction.

By definition we have $\widetilde{s} = (s - 1/n) \in \Q$. Therefore $\widetilde{s}$ is an upper bound for $A$ in $\Q$. Since $s=\sup A$ is the smallest upper bound, see (@eq-sup-contradiction-2), it follows that
$$
s \leq \widetilde{s} \,.
$$
However 
$$
\widetilde{s} := s - \frac{1}{n} < s \,,
$$
obtaining a contradiction. Then $s \notin A$. 

*Conclusion.*  We have assumed by contradiction that $s = \sup A$ exists in $\Q$. In this case either $s \in A$ or $s \notin A$. In both instances we found a contradiction. Therefore $\sup A$ does not exist in $\Q$.    
:::

The above theorem shows that the supremum does not necessarily exist. What about the infimum? 


::: Question
Let $A \subseteq K$ be non-empty and bounded below. Does
$$
\inf A 
$$
always exist?
:::

The answer to the above question is again **NO**. A set bounded below for which the infimum does nor exist is, for example, 
$$
A = (\sqrt{2}, 10] \cap \Q \,.
$$
The proof of this fact is, of course, very similar to the one of Theorem \ref{theorem-Q-not-complete}, and is therefore omitted.


In conclusion, infimum and supremum do not exist in general. The fields for which all bounded sets admit supremum or infimum are called **complete**.

### Completeness

Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field. We say that $K$ is **complete** if it holds the property:

-A:= \{ -a \divider a \in A   \}
$$
is non-empty and bounded above. By completeness we have that $\sup(-A)$ exists in $K$. From Proposition \ref{proposition-inf-sup} we deduce that $\inf A$ exists in $K$, with
$$
\inf A = - \sup (-A)\,.

## Equivalence of Completeness and Cut Property



We can show that **Completeness** is equivalent to the **Cut Property**.


::: Theorem 
### Equivalence of Cut Property and Completeness  {#theorem-cut-complete}
Let $(K,+,\cdot, \leq)$ be an ordered field. They are equivalent:

1. $K$ has the **Cut Property**
2. $K$ is **Complete**

:::


::: Remark
### Ideas for proving Theorem \ref{theorem-cut-complete}

The proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-cut-complete} is rather long, but the ideas are simple:

*Step 1. Cut Property $\implies$ Completeness*. 

Suppose $K$ has the Cut Property. To prove that $K$ is Complete, we need to: 

1. Consider an arbitrary set $A \subseteq K$ such that $A \neq \emptyset$ and $A$ is bounded above.

2. Show that $A$ has a supremum.  

To achieve this, consider the set of upper bounds of $A$
$$
B := \{ b \in K \divider b \geq a \,, \,\, \forall a \in A \} \,,
$$
We can show that the pair
$$
(B^c,B)
$$
is a Cut of $K$. As $K$ has the Cut Property, then there exists
$s \in K$ separator of $(B^c,B)$. We will show that such separator $s$ is the supremum of $A$, i.e., 
$$
s = \sup A \,.
$$
This proves completeness of $K$. See @fig-cut-complete-1 for a schematic picture of the above construction.


*Step 2. Completeness $\implies$ Cut Property*.

Conversely, suppose that $K$ is Complete. To prove that $K$ has the Cut Property, we need to:

1. Consider a cut $(A,B)$ of $K$.
2. Show that $(A,B)$ has a separator $s \in K$.

This implication is easier. Indeed, since $A$ is non-empty and bounded above (by the elements of $B$), by Completeness there exists
$$
s:=\sup A \in K \,.
$$
We will show that $s$ is a separator for the cut $(A,B)$, and therefore $K$ has the Cut Property. See @fig-cut-complete-2 for a schematic picture of the above construction.

Keeping the above ideas in mind, let us proceed with the proof.

::: Proof 
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-cut-complete}

*Step 1. Cut Property $\implies$ Completeness*.  
We need to prove that $K$ is complete. To this end, consider $A \subseteq K$ non-empty and bounded above. Define the set of upper bounds of $A$:
$$
B := \{ b \in K \divider b \geq a \,, \,\, \forall a \in A \} \,.
$$



*Claim. The pair $(B^c,B)$ is a cut of $K$.*  


*Proof of Claim*.  We have to prove two points:

- $(B^c,B)$ forms a partition of $K$. 

> Indeed, we have $B \neq \emptyset$, since $A$ is bounded above. Further, we have $B^c \neq \emptyset$, since $A$ is non-empty. Thus
$$
K = B^c \cup B \,, \quad B^c \cap B =  \emptyset \,.
$$
Then $(B^c,B)$ is a partition of $K$.

- We have
$$
x \leq y \,, \quad \forall \, x \in B^c\,, \,\forall \, y \in B \,.
$${#eq-equiv-cut-complete-1}

> To show the above, let $x \in B^c$ and $y \in B$. By definition of $B$ we have that elements of $B^c$ are not upper bounds of $A$. Therefore $x$ is not an upper bound. This means there exists $\widetilde{a} \in A$ which is larger than $x$, that is,
$$
x \leq \widetilde{a} \,.
$$
Since $y \in B$, then $y$ is an upper bound for $A$, so that 
$$
a \leq y \,, \,\, \forall a \in A\,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
x \leq \widetilde{a} \leq y \,,
$$
concluding (@eq-equiv-cut-complete-1).

Thus $(B^c,B)$ is a cut of $K$ and the claim is proven.

Since $(B^c,B)$ is a cut of $K$, by the Cut Property there exists a separator $s \in K$ such that 
$$
x \leq s \leq y \,, \quad \forall \, x \in B^c\,, \,\forall \, y \in B \,.
$${#eq-equiv-cut-complete-2}

*Claim. $s$ is an upper bound for $A$.*  

*Proof of Claim.*  
Suppose by contradiction that $s$ is not an upper bound for $A$. Therefore by definition of upper bound, there exists $\widetilde{a} \in A$ such that 
$$
s < \widetilde{a} \,.
$$
Consider the mid-point between $s$ and $\widetilde{a}$, that is, 
$$
m:=\frac{s + \widetilde{a}}{2} \in K \,.
$$
Since $m$ is the mid-point between $s$ and $\widetilde{a}$, and $s < \widetilde{a}$, it holds
$$
s < m < \widetilde{a} \,.
$$

> Indeed, since $s < \widetilde{a}$ then
$$
s = \frac{2s}{2} < \frac{s + \widetilde{a}}{2} < \frac{2 \widetilde{a}}{2} = \widetilde{a} \,.
$$

In particular the above tells us that $m$ is not an upper bound for $A$, given that $\widetilde{a} \in A$ and $m < \widetilde{a}$. Therefore $m \in B^c$, by definition of $B^c$. Therefore(@eq-equiv-cut-complete-2) implies
$$
m \leq s \,,
$$
which contradicts $s < m$. Hence $s$ is an upper bound of $A$, concluding the proof of Claim.


*Conclusion*. We have shown that $s$ is an upper bound of $A$. Condition  
(@eq-equiv-cut-complete-2) tells us that 
$$
s \leq y \,, \,\, \forall y \in B \,.
$$
Recalling that $B$ is the set of upper bounds of $A$, this means that $s$ is the smallest upper bound of $A$, that is, 
$$
s = \sup A \in K \,.
$$

*Step 2. Completeness $\implies$ Cut Property*.  
Suppose $K$ is complete. We need to show that $K$ has the Cut Property. Therefore assume $(A,B)$ is a cut of $K$, that is, 
$$
A \neq \emptyset\,, \quad B \neq \emptyset \,,
$$
$$
K = A \cup B\,, \quad A \cap B = \emptyset \,,
$$
$$
a \leq b \,, \quad \forall a \in A \,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$${#eq-equiv-cut-complete-3}
Since $B \neq \emptyset$, from (@eq-equiv-cut-complete-3) it follows that $A$ is bounded above: indeed, every element of $B$ is an upper bound for $A$, thanks to (@eq-equiv-cut-complete-3). Since $A \neq \emptyset$, by the Axiom of Completeness we have
$$
s = \sup A \in K \,.
$$
In particular, by definition of supremum, we have 
$$
a \leq s \,, \,\, \forall \, a \in A \,. 
$$
Let now $b \in B$ be arbitrary. From (@eq-equiv-cut-complete-3) we have that 
$$
a \leq b \,, \,\, \forall \, a \in A \,.
$${#eq-equiv-cut-complete-4}
Therefore $b$ is an upper bound of $A$. Since $s = \sup A$, we have that $s$ is the smallest upper bound, and so 
$$
s \leq b \,.
$$
Given that $b \in B$ was arbitrary, it actually holds
$$
s \leq b \,, \,\, \forall \,  b \in B \,.
$${#eq-equiv-cut-complete-5}
From (@eq-equiv-cut-complete-4) and (@eq-equiv-cut-complete-5) we therefore have 
$$
a \leq s \leq b \,, \,\, \forall a \in A \,,  \, \forall \, b \in B \,,
$$
showing that $s$ is a separator of $(A,B)$. Thus $K$ has the Cut Property.

## Axioms of Real Numbers

We now have all the key elements to introduce the Real Numbers $\R$. These ingredients are:

- Definition of **ordered field**,
- The **Cut Property** or **Axiom of Completeness**.

The definition of $\R$ is given in an axiomatic way.


::: Definition
### System of Real Numbers $\R$   {#definition-R}

A system of Real Numbers is a set $\R$ with two operations $+$ and $\cdot$, and
a total order relation $\leq$, such that


- $(\R,+,\cdot, \leq)$ is an ordered field

- $\R$ sastisfies the Axiom of Completeness

For reader's convenience we explicitly state the above mentioned properties.


1. There is an operation $+$ of **addition** on $\R$ 
$$
+\ \colon \R \times \R \to \R \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x + y 
$$
The addition satisifes: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in \R$
    - (A1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$
    x+y = y+x 
    $$
    $$
    (x+y)+z = x+(y+z) 
    $$
    - (A2) **Additive Identity**: $\,\exists \, 0 \in \R \st$
    $$ 
    x + 0 = 0 + x = x 
    $$
    - (A3) **Additive Inverse**: $\, \exists \, (-x) \in \R \st$
    $$
    x + (-x) = (-x) + x = 0 
    $$

2. There is an operation $\cdot$ of **multiplication** on $\R$
$$
\cdot\ \colon \R \times \R \to \R \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x \cdot y  = xy 
$$ 
The multiplication satisifes: $\, \forall \, x,y,z \in \R$
    - (M1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$
    x \cdot y = y \cdot x
    $$
    $$
    (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z) 
    $$
    - (M2) **Multiplicative Identity**: $\, \exists \, 1 \in \R \st$
    $$ 
    x \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot x = x 
    $$
    - (M3) **Multiplicative Inverse**: If $x \neq 0 \,, \,\, \exists \, x^{-1} \in \R \st$
    $$
    x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = 1 
    $$



3. There is a relation $\leq$ of **total order** on $\R$. The order satisfies: $\, \forall \, x, y, z \in \R$ 
    - (O1) **Reflexivity**: 
    $$
    x \leq x
    $$ 
    - (O2) **Antisymmetry**: 
    $$
    x \leq y \, \mbox{ and } \, y \leq x \,\, \implies \,\, x = y 
    $$
    - (O3) **Transitivity**: 
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, y \leq z \,\, \implies \,\, x = z 
    $$
    - (O4) **Total order**:  
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, y \leq x 
    $$

4. The operations $+$ and $\cdot$, and the total order $\leq$, are related by the following properties: $\, \forall x, y, z \in \R$
    - (AM) **Distributive**: Relates addition and multiplication via
    $$
    x \cdot (y + z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z 
    $$
    - (AO) Relates addition and order with the requirement:
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \implies \,\, x + z \leq y + z
    $$
    - (MO) Relates multiplication and order with the requirement:
    $$
    x \geq 0, \, y \geq 0  \,\, \implies \,\, x \cdot y  \geq 0
    $$

5. **Axiom of Completeness**:
    - (AC) For every $A \subseteq \R$ non-empty and bounded above, there exists 
    $$
    \sup A \in \R
    $$   

:::



::: Remark
Since **Axiom of Completeness** and **Cut Property** are equivalent by Theorem \ref{theorem-cut-complete}, one can replace the Axiom of Completeness in Definition \ref{definition-R} Point 5  with:  

5. **Cut Property** holds:
    - (CP) Every cut $(A,B)$ of $\R$ admits a **separator** $s \in \R \, \st$
    $$
    a \leq s \leq b \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,, \,\forall \, b \in B 
    $$

:::


::: Notation
For $x \in \R$, $x \neq 0$, the multiplicative inverse is also denoted by 
$$
x^{-1} := \frac{1}{x} \,.
$$
:::







::: Remark

Recall that

- $(K,+,\cdot)$ is a **field** if they hold:
$$
\mbox{(A1)-(A3), (M1)-(M3), (AM)}
$$ 

- $(K,+,\cdot, \leq)$ is an **ordered field** if they hold 
$$
\mbox{(A1)-(A3), (M1)-(M3), (O1)-(O4) ,(AM), (AO), (MO)}
$$ 

In particular we have that
$$
(\R,+, \cdot,\leq)
$$ 
is a **complete ordered field**: that is, an ordered field in which the **Cut Property** (CP) or **Axiom of Completeness** (AC) hold.
:::




::: Question

There are two main questions here:

1. We have only postulated the existence of $\R$. Does such complete ordered field actually exist?

2. Is $\R$ the only complete ordered field?

:::

The answer to both questions is **YES**: 


1. There are several equivalent methods for explicitly constructing the system $\R$. One such method uses **Dedekind cuts**. The interested reader can refer to the Appendix in Chapter 1 of [@rudin_introduction], or Chapter 8.6 in [@abbott]. 

2. It can be shown that $(\R,+, \cdot,\leq)$ is the **only** complete ordered field. Uniqueness is intended in the following sense: if $(K,+, \cdot,\leq)$ is another complete ordered field, then $K$ *looks like* $\R$. Mathematically this means that there exists an invertible map 
$\Psi \ \colon \R \to K$, called isomorphism of fields, which preserves the operations $+$, $\cdot$ and the order $\leq$.



In particular the following Theorem can be proven.

::: Theorem
### Existence of the Real Numbers

There exists a complete ordered field $(\R,+,\cdot, \leq)$ called the System of Real Numbers. Moreover $\R$ is unique, up to isomorphism of fields.

:::







## Special subsets of $\R$


In Definition \ref{definition-R}, we introduced $\R$ as a complete ordered field, doing so axiomatically and in a non-constructive manner. But what about the sets $\N$, $\Z$, $\Q$ now? Are they still well-defined? Specifically, can we say that
$$
\N \,, \Z \,, \Q \, \subseteq \R \,?
$$
The definitions we provided in @sec-chap-1 for $\N$, $\Z$, and $\Q$ are not directly linked to the real number system $\R$ we just introduced. To address this issue, we will need to define new sets
$$
\N_{\R}, \,\, \Z_{\R}\,, \,\, \Q_{\R}
$$
from scratch, relying solely on the axioms of $\R$. The subscript $\R$ is used here to clearly distinguish these new sets from the original ones.


### Natural numbers 

Let us start with the definition of ${\N}_{\R}$. We would like ${\N}_{\R}$ to be
$$
{\N}_{\R} = \{ \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{2} , \mathbf{3} , \ldots \} \,.
$$
We are denoting the above numbers with bold symbols in order to distinguish them from the elements of $\R$. The key property that we would like ${\N}_{\R}$ to have is the following:
$$
\mbox{Every } \mathbf{n} \in {\N}_{\R}  \, \mbox{ has a successor } \, (\mathbf{n+1}) \in {\N}_{\R} \,.
$$
How do we ensure this property? We could start by defining
$$
\mathbf{1}:=1\,,
$$
with $1$ the neutral element of the multiplication in $\R$, which exists by the field axiom (M2) in Defintion \ref{definition-R}. We could then define $\mathbf{2}$ by setting
$$
\mathbf{2} := 1 + 1 \,.
$$
We need a formal definition to capture this idea.


::: Definition
### Inductive set
Let $S \subseteq \R$. We say that $S$ is an inductive set if they are satisfied:

- $1 \in S$,
- If $x \in S$, then $(x + 1) \in S$.

:::


Note that in the above definition we just used:

- The existence of the neutral element $1$, given by axiom (M2). 
- The operation of sum in $\R$, which is again given as an axiom.


::: Example

**Question.** Prove the following:

1. $\R$ is an inductive set.  

2. The set $A=\{0,1\}$ is not an inductive set.  

**Solution.**

1. We have that $1 \in \R$ by axiom (M2). Moreover $(x + 1) \in \R$ for every $x \in \R$, by definition of sum $+$.

2. We have $1 \in A$, but $(1 + 1) \notin A$, since $1 + 1 \neq 0$.

:::


Since $\R$ is itself an inductive set, it is clear that the definition of inductive set is not
sufficient to fully describe our intuitive idea of ${\N}_{\R}$. The right way to define ${\N}_{\R}$ is as follows:
$$
{\N}_{\R} \mbox{ is the smallest inductive subset of } \R \,.
$$
To make the above definition precise, we first need a Proposition.

::: Proposition

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a collection of inductive subsets of $\R$. Then
$$
S := \bigcap_{M \in \mathcal{M}} \, M 
$$
is an inductive subset of $\R$.

:::


::: Proof

We have to show that the two properties of inductive sets hold for $S$:

1. We have $1 \in M$ for every $M \in \mathcal{M}$, since these are inductive sets. Thus
$$
1 \in \bigcap_{M \in \mathcal{M}} \, M  = S \,.
$$

2. Suppose that $x \in S$. By definition of $S$ this implies that $x \in M$ for all $M \in \mathcal{M}$. Since $M$ is an inductive set, then $(x + 1) \in M$. Therefore $(x+1) \in M$ for all $M \in \mathcal{M}$, showing that $(x+1) \in S$.

Therefore $S$ is an inductive set.
:::


We are now ready to define the natural numbers ${\N}_{\R}$.

::: Definition
### Set of Natural Numbers  {#definition-natural-numbers}

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the collection of **all** inductive subsets of $\R$. 
We define the set of natural numbers in $\R$ as 
$$
{\N}_{\R} := \bigcap_{M \in \mathcal{M}} \, M \,.
$$

:::

Therefore ${\N}_{\R}$ is the intersection of all the inductive subsets of $\R$. From
this definition it follows that ${\N}_{\R}$ is the smallest inductive subset of $\R$, as
shown in the following Proposition.


::: Proposition  
### ${\N}_{\R}$ is the smallest inductive subset of $\R$   {#proposition-smallest-inductive}

Let $C \subseteq \R$ be an inductive subset. Then
$$
{\N}_{\R} \subseteq C \,.
$$
In other words, ${\N}_{\R}$ is the smallest inductive set in $\R$.
:::


::: Proof

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the collection of **all** inductive subsets of $\R$.
By definition
$$
{\N}_{\R} = \bigcap_{M \in \mathcal{M}} \, M \,.
$$
Let $x \in {\N}_{\R}$. Then $x \in M$ for all $M \in \mathcal{M}$. Since
$C \in \mathcal{M}$ then $x \in C$. This shows ${\N}_{\R} \subseteq C$.

:::


The definition of ${\N}_{\R}$ guarantees that all numbers in ${\N}_{\R}$ are larger than $1$.


::: {.Theorem   #theorem-n-1} 

Let $x \in {\N}_{\R}$. Then
$$
x \geq 1 \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

Define the set 
$$
C := \{ x \in \R \divider x \geq 1 \} \,.
$$
We have that $C$ is an inductive subset of $\R$.

> By definition $1 \in C$. Suppose now that $x \in C$, so that $x \geq 1$. Since $1 \geq 0$ as a consequence of the field axioms, we deduce that 
$$
x + 1 \geq x + 0 = x \geq 1 \,,
$$
showing that $x + 1 \geq 1$. Thus $(x + 1) \in C$. 


By Proposition \ref{proposition-smallest-inductive} we conclude that
$$
{\N}_{\R} \subseteq C \,,
$$
showing that $x \geq 1$ for all $x \in {\N}_{\R}$.

:::


::: Notation

We have just shown that all the numbers $x \in {\N}_{\R}$ satisfy
$$
x \geq 1 \,.
$$
Moreover, by the fact that ${\N}_{\R}$ is an inductive set, we know that 
$$
1 + 1 \in {\N}_{\R} \,,
$$
since $1 \in {\N}_{\R}$. We denote 
$$
2 := 1 + 1\,. 
$$
Similarly, we will have that 
$$
2 + 1 \in {\N}_{\R}\,,
$$
since $2 \in {\N}_{\R}$. We denote 
$$
3 := 2 + 1\,.
$$
In this way we give a name to all the numbers in ${\N}_{\R}$.

:::




### Principle of induction


The Principle of Induction is a consequence of the definition of ${\N}_{\R}$, see Definition \ref{definition-natural-numbers}, and of the field axioms of $\R$ in Definition \ref{definition-R}. 


::: Theorem
### Principle of Induction   {#theorem-induction-new}

Let $\alpha(n)$ be a statement depending on $n \in {\N}_{\R}$. Assume that 

1. $\alpha(1)$ is true.
2. If $\alpha(n)$ is true then also $\alpha(n+1)$ is true.

Then $\alpha(n)$ is true for all $n \in {\N}_{\R}$.

:::


::: Proof

Define the set 
$$
C:=\{  x \in {\N}_{\R} \divider \alpha(n) \mbox{ is true} \} \,. 
$$
We have that $C$ is an inductive subset of $\R$. 

> Indeed:  
>
> - $1 \in C$ since $\alpha(1)$ is true by assumption.
> - If $n \in C$ then $\alpha(n)$ is true. By assumption $\alpha(n+1)$ is true. Therefore $(n+1) \in C$.


By Proposition \ref{proposition-smallest-inductive} we conclude that
$$
{\N}_{\R} \subseteq C\,.
$$
As by definition $C \subseteq {\N}_{\R}$, we have proven that 
$$
{\N}_{\R} = C \,,
$$
showing that $\alpha(n)$ is true for all $n \in {\N}_{\R}$.

:::





As a consequence of the principle of induction, we can prove that ${\N}_{\R}$ is closed 
under the field operations of sum and multiplication. 


::: {.Theorem #theorem-N-closed}


For all $n,m \in {\N}_{\R}$ we have:

1. ${\N}_{\R}$ is closed under addition, that is, 
$$
m + n \in {\N}_{\R} \,.
$$

2. ${\N}_{\R}$ is closed under multiplication, that is, 
$$
m \cdot n \in {\N}_{\R} \,,
$$

3. If $m > n$ there exists $k \in {\N}_{\R}$ such that
$$
m = n + k \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We only prove the first point, the other statements are left as an exercise. Fix $m \in {\N}_{\R}$. We prove that 
$$
m + n \in {\N}_{\R} \,, \quad  \forall \, n \in {\N}_{\R} \,,
$${#eq-proof-sum-closed}
by using induction.

- Induction base: We have $m+1 \in {\N}_{\R}$, since $m \in {\N}_{\R}$ and ${\N}_{\R}$ is an inductive set.
- Inductive hypothesis: Suppose $m+n \in {\N}_{\R}$. Since ${\N}_{\R}$ is an inductive set, we have $(m+n)+ 1 \in {\N}_{\R}$. By associativity of the sum, see axiom (A1), we get 
$$
m + (n + 1) = ( m + n ) + 1 \in {\N}_{\R} \,,
$$
which is the desired theis.

By the Induction Principle of Theorem \ref{theorem-induction-new} we conclude (@eq-proof-sum-closed).


:::


As a consequence of the above theorem, we see that the restriction of the operations of sum and multiplication to ${\N}_{\R}$ are still binary operations: 
$$
+ \, \colon {\N}_{\R} \times {\N}_{\R} \to {\N}_{\R} \,, \quad
\cdot \, \colon {\N}_{\R} \times {\N}_{\R} \to {\N}_{\R} \,.
$$

Equipped with the above operations, ${\N}_{\R}$ satisfies the following properties.


::: Theorem

$({\N}_{\R}, + , \cdot, \leq )$ satisfies the following axioms from Definition \ref{definition-R}:

- (A1).
- (M1), (M2).
- (O1)-(O4).
- (AM), (AO), (MO).

:::

The proof is trivial, as it follows immediately from the inclusion of ${\N}_{\R}$ in $\R$.




### Integers

We have seen in Theorem \ref{theorem-N-closed} that ${\N}_{\R}$ is closed under addition.
However ${\N}_{\R}$ is not closed under subtraction. We therefore define the set 
of **integers** ${\Z}_{\R}$ in a way that we can perform subtraction of any two
natural numbers. 


::: Definition 
### Set of Integers
The set of integers in $\R$ is defined by
$$
{\Z}_{\R} := \{  m - n \divider n,m \in {\N}_{\R}   \} \,.
$$
:::


In the definition of ${\Z}_{\R}$ we denote by $-n$ the inverse of $n$ in $\R$, which exists 
by the field axiom (A3) in Definition \ref{definition-R}. The following characterization explains the relationship between ${\Z}_{\R}$ and ${\N}_{\R}$.

::: {.Theorem  #theorem-equivalent-Z}

It holds
$$
{\Z}_{\R} = \{  -n \divider n \in {\N}_{\R}   \}  \cup \{0\}  \cup  {\N}_{\R}  \,.
$$

:::

::: Proof

Define the set
$$
M:=  \{  -n \divider n \in {\N}_{\R}   \}  \cup \{0\}  \cup  {\N}_{\R}  \,.
$$

- $M \subseteq {\Z}_{\R}$:  Suppose $m \in M$. We have 3 cases:

    - If $m \in \{ -n \divider n \in {\N}_{\R}\}$ then there exists $n \in {\N}_{\R}$ such that 
    $m=-n$. Thus
    $$
    m = -n = 1 - (n+1) \in {\Z}_{\R} \,,
    $$
    since $1 \in {\N}_{\R}$ and $n+1 \in {\N}_{\R}$ because $n \in {\N}_{\R}$.
    - If $m=0$ then 
    $$
    m = 0 = 1 - 1 \in {\Z}_{\R}\,,
    $$
    as $1 \in {\N}_{\R}$.
    - If $m \in {\N}_{\R}$ then
    $$
    m =  (m + 1) - 1 \in {\Z}_{\R}  \,,
    $$
    since $1 \in {\N}_{\R}$ and $m+1 \in {\N}_{\R}$, given that $m \in {\N}_{\R}$.

  In all 3 cases we have shown that $m \in {\Z}_{\R}$, proving that $M \subseteq {\Z}_{\R}$.

- ${\Z}_{\R} \subseteq M$: Let $z \in {\Z}_{\R}$. Then $z = m - n$ for some $n,m \in {\N}_{\R}$. We have 3 cases:

    - If $m=n$ then 
    $$
    z = m - n = m - m \stackrel{(A3)}{=} 0 \in M \,.
    $$
    - If $m>n$, by Theorem \ref{theorem-N-closed} there exists $k \in {\N}_{\R}$ such that
    $m = k + n$. Therefore 
    \begin{align*}
    z & = m - n = (k + n) - n  \\
      & \stackrel{(A1)}{=} k + (n-n) \stackrel{(A3)}{=} k + 0 \\
      & \stackrel{(A2)}{=} k   \in M \,,
    \end{align*}
    since $k \in {\N}_{\R}$.
    - If $m<n$, by Theorem \ref{theorem-N-closed} there exists $k \in {\N}_{\R}$ such that
    $n = k + m$. Therefore 
    $$
    z = m - n = - k  \in M \,,
    $$
    since $k \in {\N}_{\R}$, where again we have used (implicitly) the field axioms (A1), (A2) and (A3).

Therefore ${\Z}_{\R} = M$.

Like we did with ${\N}_{\R}$, we can also show that ${\Z}_{\R}$ is closed under
the operations of sum and multiplication. 


::: {.Theorem #theorem-Z-closed}


For all $n,m \in {\Z}_{\R}$ we have:

1. ${\Z}_{\R}$ is closed under addition, that is, 
$$
m + n \in {\Z}_{\R} \,.
$$

2. ${\Z}_{\R}$ is closed under multiplication, that is, 
$$
m \cdot n \in {\Z}_{\R} \,,
$$


:::


The proof is left as an exercise. As a consequence of Theorem \ref{theorem-Z-closed} we have that the restriction of the operations of sum and multiplication to ${\Z}_{\R}$ are still binary operations: 
$$
+ \, \colon {\Z}_{\R} \times {\Z}_{\R} \to {\Z}_{\R} \,, \quad
\cdot \, \colon {\Z}_{\R} \times {\Z}_{\R} \to {\Z}_{\R} \,.
$$

Equipped with the above operations, ${\Z}_{\R}$ satisfies the following properties.


::: {.Theorem #theorem-Z-axioms}

$({\Z}_{\R}, + , \cdot, \leq )$ satisfies the following axioms from Definition \ref{definition-R}:

- (A1), (A2), (A3).
- (M1), (M2).
- (O1)-(O4).
- (AM), (AO), (MO).

:::


::: Proof

The fact that 
$$
\mbox{(A1), (A2), (M1), (M2), (O1)-(O4), (AM), (AO), (MO)}
$$
are satisfied descends immediately from the inclusion
$$
{\Z}_{\R} \subseteq \R \,.
$$
We are left to prove (A3). This is non-trivial because a priori the additive inverse $-z$ 
of some $z \in {\Z}_{\R}$ belongs to $\R$. We need to check that $- z \in {\Z}_{\R}$. Indeed, since 
$z \in {\Z}_{\R}$, there exist $n,m \in {\N}_{\R}$ such that $z = m - n$. Define $y:= n - m$. We have that $y \in {\Z}_{\R}$ and
$$
z + y = (m - n) + (n - m) = (m - m) + (n - n) = 0 \,.
$$
Therefore $y$ is the inverse of $z$ and $y \in {\Z}_{\R}$, proving that the sum in ${\Z}_{\R}$ 
satisfies (A3).

### Rational numbers

In Theorem \ref{theorem-Z-axioms} and \ref{remark-Z-axioms} we have seen that ${\Z}_{\R}$ satisfy
all the field axiom, except for (M3). We therefore extend ${\Z}_{\R}$ in a way 
that the extension contains multiplicative inverses. The extension is the set of 
rational numbers ${\Q}_{\R}$.

::: Definition
### Set of Rational Numbers

The set of rational numbers in $\R$ is
$$
{\Q}_{\R} := \left\{   \frac{m}{n} \divider m \in {\Z}_{\R}\,, \,\, n \in {\N}_{\R}     \right\} \,.
$$

:::

Notice that in the above definition we are just using the field axiom (M3), with 
$$
\frac{m}{n} := m \cdot n^{-1} \,.
$$
The inverse of $n$ exists because we are assuming $n \in {\N}_{\R}$, and therefore 
$n$ cannot be $0$, as a consequence of Theorem \ref{theorem-n-1}.



The set ${\Q}_{\R}$ is closed under addition and multiplication (exercise). Therefore they
are well defined the operations:
$$
+ \, \colon {\Q}_{\R} \times {\Q}_{\R} \to {\Q}_{\R} \,, \quad
\cdot \, \colon {\Q}_{\R} \times {\Q}_{\R} \to {\Q}_{\R} \,.
$$


::: Theorem 

$({\Q}_{\R}, + , \cdot, \leq)$ is an ordered field.

:::

::: Proof

All the field properties, except for (M3), follow from the inclusion
$$
{\Q}_{\R} \subseteq \R
$$
and from the field properties of $\R$. To check (M3), let $q \in {\Q}_{\R}$ with $q \neq 0$. Therefore
$q = m/n$ for $m \in {\Z}_{\R}$, $n \in {\N}_{\R}$. As $q \neq 0$ and $n \neq 0$, see Theorem
\ref{theorem-n-1}, we deduce that $m \neq 0$. We have two cases:

- $m>0$: In this case $m \in {\N}_{\R}$ by Theorem \ref{theorem-equivalent-Z}. Therefore 
$$
p = \frac{n}{m} \in {\Q}_{\R} 
$$
by definition, since $n,m \in {\N}_{\R}$. By commutativity we have 
$$
q \cdot p = \frac{m}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{m} = 1 \,.
$$
- $m<0$: Then $m=-x$ with $x \in {\N}_{\R}$ by Theorem \ref{theorem-equivalent-Z}. Therefore 
$$
p = \frac{-n}{x} \in {\Q}_{\R} 
$$
by definition, since $-n \in {\Z}_{\R}$ and $x \in {\N}_{\R}$. By commutativity we have 
$$
q \cdot p = \frac{m}{n} \cdot \frac{-n}{x} = \frac{m}{n} \cdot \frac{-n}{-m} = 1 \,.
$$

Therefore $q$ always admits a multiplicative inverse $q^{-1}$ belonging to ${\Q}_{\R}$, 
proving (M3).

:::



The set ${\Q}_{\R}$ does not have the Cut Property or the Axiom of Completeness. 


::: Theorem

${\Q}_{\R}$ is not complete.

:::


The proof of the above Theorem replicates exactly the proof of Theorem 
\ref{theorem-Q-not-complete}: This is because the proof of Theorem 
\ref{theorem-Q-not-complete} only makes use of field 
axioms, and thus it applies to ${\Q}_{\R}$.



::: Notation

From now on we denote 
$$
\N := {\N}_{\R} \,,  \quad 
\Z := {\Z}_{\R} \,,  \quad 
\Q := {\Q}_{\R} \,,  \quad 
$$
dropping the subscript $\R$.
