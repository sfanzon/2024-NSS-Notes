# Introduction {#sec-chap-1}

The first aim of this lecture notes is to rigorously introduce the set of **real numbers**, which is denoted by $\R$. But what do we mean by real numbers? To start our discussion, introduce the set of natural numbers (or non-negative integers)
$$
\N = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots\}
$$

On this set we have a notion of **sum** of two numbers, denoted as usual by 
$$
n+m
$$ 

for $n,m \in \N$. Here the symbol $\in$ denotes that $m$ and $n$ belong to $\N$. For example $3+7$ results in $10$.


::: {.Question #Question-1}

Can the sum be inverted? That is, given any $n,m \in \N$, can you always find $x \in \N$ such that
$$
n+x = m \,?
$$ {#eq-inverting-sum}

:::

Of course to invert (@eq-inverting-sum) we can just perform a **subtraction**, implying that 

$$
x = m - n \,.
$$

But there is a catch. In general $x$ does not need to be in $\N$. For example, take $n=10$ and $m=1$. Then $x = -9$, which does not belong to $\N$. Therefore the answer to Question \ref{Question-1} is **NO**.

To make sure that we can always invert the sum, we need to **extend** the
set $\N$. This is done simply by introducing the set of **integers** 
$$
\Z := \{ -n,n \, \colon \, n \in \N   \} \,,
$$

that is, the set

$$
\Z := \{ \ldots, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots \} \,.
$$

The sum can be extended to $\Z$, by defining 
$$
(-n) + (-m) := - (m+n)
$$ {#eq-def-sum-negative}

for all $m,n \in \N$. Now every element of $\Z$ possesses an **inverse**, that is, for each $n \in \Z$, there exists $m \in \Z$, such that
$$
n + m = 0 \,.
$$

Can we characterize $m$ explicitly? Of course! Seeing the definition at (@eq-def-sum-negative), we simply have
$$
m = - n \,.
$$

On the set $\Z$ we can also define the operation of **multiplication**, in the usual way we learnt in school. For 
$n,m \in \Z$, we denote the multiplication by $nm$ or $n \cdot m$. For example $7 \cdot 2 = 14$ and $1 \cdot (-1) = -1$.


::: {.Question #Question-2}

Can the multiplication in $\Z$ be inverted? That is, given any $n,m \in \Z$, can you always find $x \in \Z$ such that
$$
nx = m \,?
$$ {#eq-multiplication}

:::

To invert (@eq-multiplication) if $n \neq 0$, we can just perform a **division**, to obtain
$$
x = \frac{m}{n} \,.
$$
But again there is a catch. Indeed taking $n=2$ and $m=1$ yields
$x = 1/2$, which does not belong to $\Z$. The answer to Question \ref{Question-2} is therefore **NO**. 

Thus, in order to invert the multiplication, we need to **extend** the set of integers $\Z$. This extension is called the set of **rational numbers**, defined by
$$
\Q := \left\{ \frac{m}{n} \, \colon \, m,n \in \Z, \, n \neq 0    \right\} \,.
$$
We then extend the operations of sum and multiplication to $\Q$ by defining
$$
\frac{m}{n} + \frac{p}{q} := \frac{mq + np}{nq} 
$$
and
$$
\frac{m}{n} \, \cdot \, \frac{p}{q} := \frac{mp}{nq}
$$
Now the multiplication is invertible in $\Q$. Specifically, each non-zero element has an inverse: the inverse of $m/n$ is given by $n/m$. 

To summarize, we have extended $\N$ to $\Z$, and $\Z$ to $\Q$. By construction we have 
$$
\N \subset \Z \subset \Q \,.
$$
Moreover **sum** and **product** are **invertible** in $\Q$. Now we are happy right? So and so.  

::: Question

Can we draw the set $\Q$?

:::


It is clear how to draw $\Z$, as seen below. 

![Representation of integers $\Z$](/images/integers.png){#fig-integers width=80%}


However $\Q$ is much **larger** than the set $\Z$ represented by the ticks in @fig-integers. What do we mean by **larger**? For example, consider $0 \in \Q$. 


::: Question
What is the number $x \in \Q$ which is closest to $0$?
:::

There is no right answer to the above question, since whichever rational number $m/n$ you consider, you can always squeeze the rational number $m / (2n)$ in between:
$$
0 < \frac{m}{2n} < \frac{m}{n} \,.
$$
For example think about the case of the numbers 
$$
\frac1n \, \text{ for } \, n \in \N, \, n \neq 0 \,.
$$
Such numbers get arbitrarily close to $0$, as depicted below.

![Fractions $\frac{1}{n}$ can get arbitrarily close to $0$](/images/integers_ratio.png){width=70%}

Maybe if we do the same reasoning with other progressively smaller rational numbers, we manage to fill out the interval $[0,1]$. In other words, we might conjecture the following. 

::: {.Conjecture #conj-line}
Maybe $\Q$ can be represented by a continuous line.
:::

Do you think the above conjecture is true? If it was, mathematics would be quite boring. Indeed Conjecture \ref{conj-line} is **false**, as shown by the Theorem below.

::: {.Theorem #theorem-root-2}
The number $\sqrt{2}$ does not belong to $\Q$.
:::

Theorem \ref{theorem-root-2} is the reason why $\sqrt{2}$ is called an **irrational number**. For reference, a few digits of $\sqrt{2}$ are given by
$$
\sqrt{2} = 1.414213562373095048\ldots
$$
and the situation is as in the picture below.

![Representing $\sqrt{2}$ on the numbers line.](/images/integers_root_2.png){width=70%}

We can therefore see that Conjecture \ref{conj-line} is **false**, and $\Q$ is not a line: indeed $\Q$ has a **gap** at $\sqrt{2}$. Let us see why 
Theorem \ref{theorem-root-2} is true.


::: Proof
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-root-2}

We prove that 
$$
\sqrt{2} \notin \Q 
$$ 
by **contradiction**. 
     
Wait, what does this mean? Proving the claim by contradiction means assuming that the claim is **false**. This means we **assume** that 
$$
\sqrt{2} \in \Q \,.
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2-false}
From this assumption we then start deducing other statements, hoping to encounter a statement which is **`FALSE`**. But if (@eq-contradiction-root-2-false) leads to a false statement, then it must be that (@eq-contradiction-root-2-false) is **`FALSE`**. Thus the contrary of  (@eq-contradiction-root-2-false) must hold, meaning that 
$$
\sqrt{2} \notin \Q 
$$ 
as we wanted to show. This would conclude the proof.

Now we need to actually show that (@eq-contradiction-root-2-false) will lead to a contradiction. Since this is our first proof, let us take it slowly, step-by-step.

1. Assuming (@eq-contradiction-root-2-false) just means that there exists $q \in \Q$ such that 
$$
q = \sqrt{2} \, .
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2}
2. Since $q \in \Q$, by definition we have
$$
q = \frac{m}{n}
$$
for some $m,n \in \N$ with $n \neq 0$.
3. Recalling (@eq-contradiction-root-2), we then have
$$
\frac{m}{n} = \sqrt{2} \,.
$$
4. We can square the above equation to get
$$
 \frac{m^2}{n^2} = 2 \,.
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2-2}
5. **Withouth loss of generality**, we can **assume** that $m$ and $n$ have no common factors.
    
    > Wait. What does Step 5 mean? You will encounter the sentence *withouth loss of generality* many times in mathematics. It is often abbreviated in **`WLOG`**. WLOG means that the assumption that follows is chosen arbitrarily, but does not affect the validity of the proof in general.  
    For example in our case we can assume that $m$ and $n$ have no common factor. This is because if $m$ and $n$ had common factors, then it would mean
    $$
    m = a \tilde{m} \,, \quad n = a \tilde{n}
    $$
    for some $a \in \N$ with $a \neq 0$. Then 
    $$
    \frac{m}{n} = \frac{ a \tilde{m} }{ a \tilde{n} } = 
    \frac{ \tilde{m} }{ \tilde{n} } \,.
    $$
    Therefore by (@eq-contradiction-root-2-2)
    $$
    \frac{ \tilde{m}^2 }{ \tilde{n}^2 } = 2 \,.
    $$
    The proof can now proceed in the same way we would have proceeded from Step 4, but in addition we have the hypothesis that $\tilde{m}$ and $\tilde{n}$ have no common factors. 
6.  Equation (@eq-contradiction-root-2-2) implies 
$$
m^2 = 2 n^2 \,.
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2-3}
Therefore the integer $m^2$ is an even number. 

    > Why is  $m^2$ even? As you already know, **even** numbers are
    $$
    0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \ldots
    $$
    All these numbers have in common that they can be divided by $2$, and so they can be written as
    $$
    2 p
    $$
    for some $p \in \N$. For example $52$ is even, because
    $$
    52 = 2 \cdot 26 \,.
    $$ 
    Instead, **odd** numbers are
    $$
    1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, \ldots
    $$
    These can be all written as
    $$
    2p + 1
    $$
    for some $p \in \N$. For example $53$ is odd, because
    $$
    52 = 2 \cdot 26 + 1 \,.
    $$ 

7. Thus $m$ is an even number, and so there exists $p \in \N$ such that 
$$
m = 2p \,.
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2-4}

    > Why is (@eq-contradiction-root-2-4) true? Let us see what happens if we take the square of an even number $m = 2p$
    $$
    m^2 = (2p)^2 = 4p^2 = 2 (2p^2) = 2 q \,.
    $$
    Thus $m^2 = 2 q$ for some $q\in \N$, and so $m^2$ is an even number. If instead $m$ is odd, then $m = 2p + 1$ and
    $$
    m^2 = (2p + 1 )^2 = 4p^2 + 4p + 1 = 2(2 p^2 + 2p) + 1 
    $$
    showing that also $m^2$ is odd.  
    This justifies Step 7: Indeed we know that $m^2$ is an even number from Step 6. If $m$ was odd, then $m^2$ would be odd. Hence $m$ must be even as well.

8. If we substitute (@eq-contradiction-root-2-4) in    (@eq-contradiction-root-2-3) we get
$$
m^2 = 2n^2 \, \implies \,  (2p)^2 = 2n^2 \, \implies \,  4 p^2 = 2 n^2
$$
Dividing both terms by $2$, we obtain
$$
n^2 = 2p^2\,. 
$${#eq-contradiction-root-2-5}
9. We now make a series of observations:
    * Equation (@eq-contradiction-root-2-5) says that $n^2$ is even. 
    * Step 6 says that $m^2$ is even.
    * Therefore $n$ and $m$ are also even.  
    * Hence $n$ and $m$ have $2$ as common factor.
    * But Step 5 says that $n$ and $m$ have no common factors.
    * **`CONTRADICTION`**
10. Our reasoning has run into a **contradiction**, starting from assumption (@eq-contradiction-root-2-false), which says that
$$
\sqrt{2} \in \Q \,.
$$
Hence the above must be **FALSE**, and so 
$$
\sqrt{2} \notin \Q \,
$$
ending the proof.
:::


Seeing that $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$, we might be tempted to just fill in the gap by adding $\sqrt{2}$ to $\Q$. However, with analogous proof to Theorem \ref{theorem-root-2}, we can prove that 
$$
\sqrt{p} \notin \Q
$$ 
for each prime number $p$. As there are infinite prime numbers, this means that $\Q$ has infinite gaps. Then we might attempt to fill in these gaps via the extension
$$
\tilde{\Q} := \Q \cup \{ \sqrt{p} \, \colon \, p \, \text{ prime} \} \,.
$$
However even this is not enough, as we would still have numbers which are not contained in $\tilde{Q}$, for example
$$
\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} , \, \pi , \, \pi + \sqrt{2} \notin \tilde{\Q} \,.
$$

::: Remark

Proving that 
$$
\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \notin \Q
$$ 
is relatively easy, and will be left as an **exercise**. Instead, proving that 
$$
\pi \notin \Q
$$ 
is way more complicated. There are several proof of the fact, all requiring mathematics which is more advanced of the one presented in this course. For some proofs, see this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_π_is_irrational).
:::


The reality of things is that to **complete** $\Q$ and make it into a **continuous line** we have to add a lot of points. Indeed, we need to add way more points than the ones already contained in $\Q$. Such extension of $\Q$ will be called $\R$, the set of **real numbers**. The inclusions will therefore be 
$$
\N \subset \Z \subset \Q \subset \R \,.
$$
The set $\R$ is not at all trivial to construct. In fact, at first we will not construct it, but just do the following:
 
* We will assume that $\R$ **exists** and satisfies some basic **axioms**.
* One of the axioms is that $\R$ fills **all** the **gaps** that $\Q$ has. Therefore $\R$ can be thought as a **continuous** line.
* We will study the **properties** of $\R$ which descend from such **axioms**. 

For example one of the properties of $\R$ will be the following:

::: Theorem
### We will prove this in the future

$\R$ contains all the square roots. This means that for every $x \in \R$ with $x \geq 0$, we have
$$
\sqrt{x} \in \R \,.
$$
:::

At the end of this chapter we will provide a concrete **model** for the real numbers $\R$, to prove once and for all that such set indeed exists.

::: Theorem
### We will prove this in the future

There exists a set $\R$, called the set of real numbers, which has the following properties:

* $\R$ extends $\Q$, that is,
$$
\Q \subset \R \,.
$$
* $\R$ satisfies certain **axioms**.
* $\R$ fills **all** the **gaps** that $\Q$ has. In particular $\R$ can be represented by a **continuous** line.
