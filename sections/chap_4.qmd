# Properties of $\mathbb{R}$

Now that we established the axiomatic definition of the Real Numbers $\R$ as a **complete ordered field**, let us investigate some of the properties of $\R$. These will be consequence of the axioms of the real numbers, particulaly of the **Axiom of Completeness**.





## Archimedean Property

The Archimedean property is one of the most useful properties of $\R$, and it essentially states that the set of natural numbers $\N$ is not bounded above in $\R$. 


More precisley, the Archimedean Property says two things:

1. For any $x \in \R$ we can always find a natural number $n \in \N$ such that
$$
n > x \,.
$$

2. For any $x \in \R$ with $x>0$, we can always find a natural number $m \in \N$ such that 
$$
0< \frac1m < x  \,.
$$

The situation is depicted in @fig-archimedean.


![For any $x>0$ we can find $n,m \in \N$ such that $1/m<x<n$.](/images/archimedean_original.png){#fig-archimedean width=80%}


::: Remark
The Archimedean property might sound trivial. However there are examples of ordered fields $K$ that satisfy:

1. $\N \subseteq K$.
2. $K$ does not have the Archimedean property.
3. In particular, $\N$ is bounded above in $K$. 

Of course such fields $K$ cannot be complete. 

> If $K$ is complete, then $K$ is essentially $\R$, and we are going to prove the Archimedean
Property holds in $\R$.
:::


Let us proceed with the precise statement of the Archimedean property in $\R$.


::: Theorem
### Archimedean Property   {#theorem-archimedean}

Let $x \in \R$ be given. Then:

1. There exists $n \in \N$ such that
$$
n > x \,.
$$

2. Suppose in addition that $x>0$. There exists $n \in \N$ such that
$$
\frac1n < x \,.
$$


:::




::: Proof

*Part 1.* Let $x \in \R$. Suppose by contradiction that there is no $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
n > x  \,.
$$
This means that 
$$
n \leq x \, \quad \forall n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-archimedean-proof-2}
The above is saying that the set $\N$ is bounded above. Since $\N$ is not empty, by the Axiom of Completeness there exists
$$
\alpha = \sup \N \,.
$$

*Claim: $(\alpha-1)$ is not an upper bound for $\N$.*

*Proof of Claim.* Indeed, we have
$$
(\alpha - 1) < \alpha \,.
$${#eq-archimedean-proof}
Therefore $\alpha-1$ cannot be an upper bound for $\N$. Indeed, if by contradiction $\alpha - 1$ was an upper bound for $\N$, then we would have
$$
\alpha \leq (\alpha - 1)\,, 
$$
since $\alpha$ is the smallest upper bound for $\N$. This contradicts (@eq-archimedean-proof). Therefore $\alpha - 1$ is not an upper bound for $\N$. 

*Conclusion.* Since $\alpha - 1$ is not an upper bound for $\N$, there exists $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
\alpha - 1 < n_0 \,.
$$
The above implies 
$$
\alpha < n_0 + 1 \,.
$$
Since 
$$
(n_0+1) \in \N \,,
$$
we have obtained a contradiction, given that $\alpha$ was the supremum of $\N$. Thus (@eq-archimedean-proof-2) is false, meaning that there exists $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
n > x \,.
$$



*Part 2.* Suppose $x \in \R$ with $x>0$. We can define
$$
y:=\frac1x \,.
$$
By Part 1 there exists $n \in \N$ such that
$$
n > y = \frac{1}{x} \,.
$$
Using that $x>0$, we can rearrange the above inequlaity to obtain
$$
\frac1n < x \,,
$$
which is the desired thesis.

:::




There is another formulation of the Archimedean Property which, depending on the situation, might
be more useful. This formulation says the following: If $x,y \in \R$ are such that 
$$
0 < x < y \,,
$$
then there exists $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
nx > y \,.
$$
In other words, if one does $n$ steps of size $x$ in the positive numbers direction, then
the resulting number $nx$ will be larger than $y$. The situation is depicted in @fig-archimedean. 




![For $0<x<y$ there exists $n \in \N$ such that that $nx>y$. In the picture $n=3$.](/images/archimedean.png){#fig-archimedean width=80%}



::: Theorem
### Archimedean Property (Alternative formulation)  {#theorem-archimedean-alternative}

Let $x,y \in \R$, with $0<x<y$. There exists $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
nx > y \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof


Suppose by contradiction that there does not exist some $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
nx > y \,.
$$
This means that
$$
nx \leq y \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-archimedean-proof-4}
Define the set
$$
A := \{ nx \divider n \in \N \} \,.
$$
Condition (@eq-archimedean-proof-4) is saying that $A$ is bounded above by $y$. Morever $A$ is trivially non-empty. By the Axiom of Completeness there exists
$$
\alpha = \sup A \,.
$$
Since $\alpha$ is the supremum of $A$, by definition of supremum and of the set $A$, we have 
$$
nx \leq \alpha \,, \quad   \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-archimedean-proof-5}
As (@eq-archimedean-proof-5) holds for every $n \in \N$, then it also holds for $(n+1)$, meaning that
$$
(n+1) x \leq \alpha \,.
$$
The above implies 
$$
nx \leq \alpha - x \,.
$$
As $n$ was arbitrary, we conclude that
$$
nx \leq \alpha - x \,, \quad   \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
The above is saying that $(\alpha - x)$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since $\alpha$ is the supremum of 
$A$, in particular $\alpha$ is the smallest upper bound. Thus it must hold
$$
\alpha \leq \alpha - x \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to 
$$
x \leq 0 \,,
$$
which contradicts our assumption of $x>0$. Therefore (@eq-archimedean-proof-4) is false, and there exists $n \in \N$ such that
$$
nx > y \,,
$$
concluding the proof.
:::







## Nested Interval Property



Another consequence of the axiom of completeness is the **Nested Interval Property**. This is yet another way of saying
the same thing: $\R$ does not have **gaps**. 

Let us look at a construction. Suppose given some closed intervals
$$
I_n := [a_n,b_n] = \{   x \in \R \divider  a_n \leq x \leq b_n   \} \,,
$$
where the end points are ordered in the following way:
$$
a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \leq \dots \leq b_n  \leq \ldots b_n \leq b_1 \,,
$$
as shown in @fig-nested. 

![Nested intervals $I_n = [a_n,b_n]$.](/images/nested_interval_property.png){#fig-nested width=80%}


The intervals $I_n$ are **nested**, meaning that 
$$
I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \supset \ldots I_n \supset \ldots
$$
For finite intersections we clearly have
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^k  I_n = I_k \,, 
$$
that is, intersecting the first $k$ intervals yields $I_k$, the smallest interval in the sequence.

::: Question

Consider the infinite intersection

$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n := \{  x \in \R \divider x \in I_n \,, \forall \, n \in \N  \}  \,.
$$

What can we say about it? Is it empty? Is it not empty?
:::

The answer is that the infinite intersection is not empty, because $\R$ was constructed in a way that it does not have gaps.




::: Theorem
### Nested Interval Property  {#theorem-nested}


For each $n \in \N$ assume given a closed interval
$$
I_n := [a_n,b_n] = \{   x \in \R \divider  a_n \leq x \leq b_n   \} \,.
$$
Suppose that the intervals are nested, that is,
$$
I_n \supset I_{n+1}\,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Then
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \neq \emptyset \,.
$${#eq-theorem-nested-proof-0}
:::


::: Proof 

By definition we have
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n := \{  x \in \R \divider x \in I_n \,, \forall \, n \in \N  \}  \,.
$$
We want to prove (@eq-theorem-nested-proof-0). This means we need to find a real number $x$ such that
$$
x \in I_n \,, \quad  \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-theorem-nested-proof-1}

> Idea of the Proof: Condition (@eq-theorem-nested-proof-1) is saying that it should hold
$$
a_n \leq x \leq b_n \ \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Since $a_n$ is increasing and $b_n$ is decreasing, the point $x$ is being squeezed between these two sequences. This suggests $x$ should be the largest (i.e. the supremum) of all $a_ns$ and smallest (i.e. the infimum) of all the $b_ns$.

Define the set
$$
A:= \{ a_n \divider n \in \N \} \,.
$$
The set $A$ is non-empty and is bounded above by any of the $b_n$. Therefore there exists 
$$
x = \sup \ A \,.
$$
By definition of supremum and definition of the set $A$, we have
$$
a_n \leq x \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
On the other hand, consider an arbitrary number $b_n$. By construction we have
$$
a_i \leq b_n \,, \quad \forall \, i \in \N \,.
$$
Therefore $b_n$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since the supremum is the smallest upper bound, 
we conclude that
$$
x \leq b_n \,.
$$
The index $n$ was chosen arbitrarily, and therefore
$$
x \leq b_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
In total we have
$$
a_n \leq x \leq b_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
showing that $x$ satisfies (@eq-theorem-nested-proof-1). Therefore (@eq-theorem-nested-proof-0) holds and the proof is concluded.
::::


::: Important

The assumption that $I_n$ is **closed** is crucial in Theorem \ref{theorem-nested}. 
Without such assumption the thesis of Theorem \ref{theorem-nested} does not hold in general, as seen in Example \ref{example-nested-open} below.

:::


::: {.Example #example-nested-open}

Consider the **open** intervals 
$$
I_n := \left( 0, \frac1n \right) \,.
$$
These are clearly nested
$$
I_n \supset I_{n+1}\,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
For this choice of $I_n$ we have
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset \,.
$${#eq-example-nested-2}
Indeed, suppose by contradiction that the intersection is non-empty. Then there exists $x \in \N$
such that 
$$
x \in I_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
By definition of $I_n$ the above reads
$$
0 < x < \frac1n  \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-example-nested}
Since $x>0$, by the Archimedean Property in Theorem \ref{theorem-archimedean} Point 2, there exists $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
0 < \frac{1}{n_0} < x \,.
$$
The above contradicts (@eq-example-nested). Therefore (@eq-example-nested-2) holds.

## Revisiting Sup and inf 


We now investigate some of the properties of supremum and infimum in $\R$. 
The first property is an alternative characterization of the supremum, which we will often use. A sketch of such characterization is in @fig-alternative-sup below.

::: Proposition 
### Characterization of Supremum  {#proposition-supremum-characterization}

Let $A \subseteq \R$ be a non-empty set. Suppose that $s \in \R$ is an upper bound for $A$. They 
are equivalent:

1. $s = \sup A$
2. For every $\e > 0$ there exists $x \in A$ such that 
$$
s - \e < x \,.
$$

:::


![Let $s = \sup A$. Then for every $\e>0$ there exist $x \in A$ such that $s-\e<x$.](/images/alternative_supremum.png){#fig-alternative-sup width=80%}


::: Proof
### Proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-supremum-characterization}

*Step 1*. Assume that 
$$
s = \sup A \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$ be arbitrary. We clearly have that
$$
s - \e < s \,.
$${#eq-proof-sup-alt-1}
Therefore $(s-\e)$ cannot be an upper bound of $A$. Indeed, if by contradiction $(s-\e)$ was 
an upper bound, then we would have
$$
s \leq (s - \e )\,,
$$
since $s$ is the smallest upper bound. The above contradicts (@eq-proof-sup-alt-1), and therefore
$(s-\e)$ is not an upper bound for $A$. Hence there exists some $x \in A$ such that
$$
s - \e < x  \, ,
$$
concluding.

*Step 2*. Assume that Point 2 in the statement of Proposition \ref{proposition-supremum-characterization} holds. By assumption we have that $s$ is an upper bound 
for $A$. Suppose by contradiction that 
$$
s \neq \sup A \,.
$$
This is equivalent to the statement
$$
s \, \mbox{ is not the smallest upper bound of } \, A. 
$${#eq-proof-sup-alt-2}
Hence there exists an upper bound $b$ of $A$ such that
$$
b < s \,.
$$
Let
$$
\e := s - b \,.
$$
By assumption there exists $x \in A$ such that 
$$
s - \e < x \,.
$$
Substituting the definition of $\e$ we get
$$
s - s + b < x \quad \implies \quad b < x \,.
$$
Since $b$ is an upper bound for $A$ and $x \in A$, the above is a contradiction. Therefore 
(@eq-proof-sup-alt-2) is false, and $s$ is the smallest upper bound of $A$. Thus $s = \sup A$.
:::




The analogue of Proposition \ref{proposition-supremum-characterization} is as follows. The proof is left as an exercise. 


::: Proposition 
### Characterization of Infimum  {#prop-supremum-infimum}

Let $A \subseteq \R$ be a non-empty set. Suppose that $i \in \R$ is a lower bound for $A$. They 
are equivalent:

1. $i = \inf A$
2. For every $\e \in \R$, with $\e > 0$, there exists $x \in A$ such that 
$$
x < i + \e  \,.
$$

:::


A sketch of the characterization in Proposition \ref{prop-supremum-infimum} can be found in @fig-alternative-inf below.

![Let $i = \inf A$. Then for every $\e>0$ there exist $x \in A$ such that $x<i+\e$.](/images/alternative_infimum.png){#fig-alternative-inf width=80%}



With the above characterizations of supremum and infimum, it will be easier, in some cases, to compute infimum and supremum.
We now characterize infimum and supremum of an open interval of $\R$.


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-interval-inf-sup}

Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a<b$. Let
$$
A:= (a,b) = \{ x \in \R \divider a < x < b \}\,.
$$
Then
$$
\inf A = a \,, \quad \sup A = b \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We will only prove that 
$$
\inf A = a \,,
$$
since the proof of 
$$
\sup A = b
$$ 
is similar. 

By definition of $A$, we have that 
$$
a < x \,, \quad \forall \, x \in A \,.
$$
The above says that $a$ is a lower bound for $A$. 

*Claim. $a$ is the largest lower bound of $A$*. 

*Proof of Claim.* Let $L$ be a lower bound for $A$, that is,
$$
L \leq x \,, \quad \forall \, x \in A \,.
$$
We have to prove that
$$
L \leq a \,.
$${#eq-interval-inf-sup-proof}
Suppose by contradiction that (@eq-interval-inf-sup-proof) does not hold, namely that
$$
a < L \,.
$$
Since $a<b$ we have
$$
a = \frac{2a}{2} < \frac{a+b}{2} < \frac{2b}{b} = b \,,
$$
showing that the midpoint between $a$ and $b$ satisfies
$$
\frac{a+b}{2} \in A \,.
$$
Since $L$ is a lower bound for $A$, we have
$$
L \leq \frac{a+b}{2} < b \,.
$${#eq-interval-inf-sup-proof-2}
In particular we have proven that $a < L <b$, which means that $L \in A$.
Consider now the midpoint between $a$ and $L$, that is, 
$$
M := \frac{a + L}{2} \,. 
$$
Since $a < L <b$, we have that
$$
M \in A \,.
$$

> Indeed, using that $a<L$, we have
$$
a = \frac{2a}{2} < \frac{a+L}{2} = M  \leq \frac{a+b}{2} \,. 
$$
Using that $L<b$, we have
$$
M = \frac{a+L}{2} \leq \frac{a+b}{2} < b \,.
$$
Thus $a < M < b$, showing that $M \in A$.


Moreover 
$$
M < L \,.
$$

> This is because $a<L$, and therefore
$$
M = \frac{a + L}{2} < \frac{2L}{2} = L \,.
$$


This is a contradiction, since $L$ is a lower bound for $A$ and $M \in A$. 
Therefore (@eq-interval-inf-sup-proof) holds, showing that $a$ is the largest lower bound of $A$. 
We conclude that $a = \inf A$.
:::


As a corollary of the above we have that the maximum and minimum of an open interval do not exist.



::: Corollary

Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a<b$. Let
$$
A:= (a,b) = \{ x \in \R \divider a < x < b \}\,.
$$
Then $\min A$ and $\max A$ do not exist.
:::

::: Proof

Suppose by contradiction that $\min A$ exists. We have shown that if the minimum of a set exists, then it must be
$$
\min A = \inf A \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\inf A = a\,,
$$
by Proposition \ref{proposition-interval-inf-sup}, we would obtain that
$$
\min A = a \,.
$$
As $\min A \in A$ by definition, we infer $a \in A$. This is contradiction. Then $\min A$ does not exist. 

The proof that $\max A$ does not exist is similar, and is left as an exercise.
:::


We can also consider intervals for which one or both of the sides are closed.


::: Corollary

Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a<b$. Let
$$
A:= [a,b) = \{ x \in \R \divider a \leq x < b \}\,.
$$
Then 
$$
\min A = \inf A = a \,, \quad \sup A = b \,,
$$ 
$\max A$ does not exist.


:::


The proof is very simple, and is left as an exercise. Let us now compute supremum and infimum of 
a set which is not an interval.


::: Proposition

Define the set
$$
A :=  \left\{ \frac1n \divider n \in \N   \right\} \,.
$$
Then
$$
\inf A = 0 \,, \quad \sup A = \max A = 1 \,.
$$
:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* We have
$$
\frac1n \leq 1 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Therefore $1$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since $1 \in A$, by definition of maximum we conclude that 
$$
\max A = 1 \,.
$$
Since the maximum exists, we conclude that also the supremum exists, and
$$
\sup A = \max A =  1 \,.
$$



*Part 2.* We have
$$
\frac1n > 0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
showing that $0$ is a lower bound for $A$. Suppose by contradiction that $0$ is not the infimum. Therefore $0$ is not the largest lower bound. Then there exists $\e \in \R$ such that:

- $\e$ is a lower bound for $A$, that is,
$$
\e \leq \frac1n  \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$${#eq-lower-bound-1-n}

- $\e$ is larger than $0$:
$$
0 < \e \,.
$$

As $\e>0$, by the Archimedean Property there exists $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
0 < \frac{1}{n_0} < \e \,.
$$
This contradicts (@eq-lower-bound-1-n). Thus $0$ is the largest lower bound of $A$, that is, $0 = \inf A$.


*Part 3.* We have that $\min A$ does not exist. Indeed suppose by contradiction that $\min A$ exists. Then 
$$
\min A = \inf A \,.
$$
As $\inf A = 0$ by Part 2, we conclude $\min A = 0$. As $\min A \in A$, we obtain $0 \in A$, which is a contradiction.
:::




## Existence of $k$-th Roots

We have started our discussion in @sec-chap-1 by proving that
$$
\sqrt{2} \notin \Q \,.
$${#eq-sqrt2-existence}
We have shown that (@eq-sqrt2-existence) implies that the set 
$$
A := \{ q \in \Q \divider q^2 < 2 \} 
$$
does not have a supremum in $\Q$. We then introduced the Real Numbers $\R$ so that each 
non-empty and bounded above set would have a supremum. As the set $A$ is non-empty and bounded above,
there exists $\alpha \in \R$ such that
$$
\alpha = \sup A \,.
$$
We are going to prove that
$$
\alpha^2 = 2 \,,
$$
which means that $\alpha$ is the square root of $2$. 

More in general, let $x \in \R$ with $x \geq 0$ and $k \in \N$. Define the set
$$
A := \{ t \in \R \divider t^k < x \} 
$$
We will see that $A$ is non-empty and bounded above. By the axiom of completeness there exists $\alpha \in \R$ such that
$$
\alpha = \sup A 
$$
In the following Theorem we will prove that
$$
\alpha^k = x \,,
$$
meaning that $\alpha$ is the $k$-th root of $x$.



::: Theorem
### Existence of $k$-th roots   {#theorem_existence_root}

Let $x \in \R$ with $x \geq 0$ and $k \in \N$. Define the set
$$
A = \{ t \in \R \divider t^k < x \} \,.
$$
There exists $\alpha \in \R$ such that
$$
\alpha = \sup A \,.
$$
Moreover it holds that
$$
\alpha^k = x \,.
$$

:::


The proof of Theorem \ref{theorem_existence_root} rests on similar ideas to the ones 
used to prove that $\Q$ does not have the cut property.

::: Proof
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem_existence_root}

*Part 1: Uniqueness.* 

Suppose $\alpha_1,\alpha_2 \in \R$ are such that
$$
\alpha_1^k = \alpha_2^k = x \,.
$$
If $\alpha_1 \neq \alpha_2$, then
$$
\alpha_1^k \neq \alpha_2^k \,,
$$
obtaining a contradiction. Therefore $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$.


*Part 2: Existence.*

Let $x \in \R$ with $x \geq 0$. If $x = 0$ there is nothing to prove, as
$$
0^k = 0 \,,
$$
so that $\alpha = 0$. Therefore we can assume $x>0$. Define the subset of $\R$
$$
A := \{  t \in \R \divider  t^k < x  \} \,.
$$
Clearly $A$ is non-empty and bounded above. 

> An upper bound is given, for example, by $b := x + 1$. Indeed, since we are assuming 
$x \geq 0$, then $x+1 \geq 1$. In particular we have 
$$
(x+1)^k \geq x + 1 \,.
$$
Let $t \in A$. Then
$$
t^k < x < x + 1 < (x+1)^k ,
$$
showing that $t< x+1$. 


By the Axiom of Completeness of $\R$, there exists $\alpha \in \R$ such that 
$$
\alpha = \sup A \,.
$$
We claim that 
$$
\alpha^k = x \,.
$${#eq-existence-root-proof-1}
Suppose by contradiction that (@eq-existence-root-proof-1) does not hold. 
We will need the formula: For all $a,b \in \R$ it holds
$$
a^k-b^k = (a - b)( a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} b + a^{k-3}b^k + \ldots + a b^{k-2} + b^{k-1} ) \,.  
$${#eq-existence-root-proof-2}
Formula (@eq-existence-root-proof-2) can be easily proven by induction on $k$.
Since we are assuming that (@eq-existence-root-proof-1) does not hold, we have two cases:

- $\alpha^k < x$: We know that $\alpha$ is the supremum of $A$. We would like to violate this, by
finding a number $L$ which is larger than $\alpha$, but still belongs to $A$. This means
$L$ has to satisfy
$$
\alpha < L  \,, \quad L^k < x \,.
$$
We look for $L$ of the form
$$
L_n := \alpha + \frac{1}{n} 
$$
for $n \in \N$ to be chosen later. Clearly
$$
\alpha < L_n \,,
$${#eq-existence-root-proof-3}
for all $n \in \N$. We now search for $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
L_{n_0}^k < x \,.  
$$
Using formula (@eq-existence-root-proof-2) with  $a = \alpha$ and $b = L_{n_0}$ we obtain
$$
L_{n_0}^k - \alpha^k = \frac{1}{n_0}  \left(  L_{n_0}^{k-1} + L_{n_0}^{k-2} \alpha + 
                        \ldots  + L_{n_0}\alpha^{k-2} + \alpha^{k-1} \right) \,.
$${#eq-existence-root-proof-4}
Now notice that (@eq-existence-root-proof-3) implies
$$
\alpha^j < L_{n_0}^j
$$
for all $j \in \N$. Using this estimate on all the terms $\alpha^j$ appearing 
in the RHS of (@eq-existence-root-proof-4) we obtain

We have therefore shown the existence of $n_0 \in \N$ such that

The above says that $L_{n_0} \in A$ and that

- $\alpha^k > x$: We know that $\alpha$ is the supremum of $A$. We would like to find a contradiction, by finding an upper bound $L$ for $A$ which is smaller than $\alpha$. This means
$L$ has to satisfy

## Density of $\Q$ in $\R$


A set $S$ is dense in $\R$ if the elements of $S$ are arbitrarily close
to the elements of $\R$. 

::: Definition
### Dense set

Let $S \subseteq \R$. We say that $S$ is dense in $\R$ if for every $x \in \R$ and $\e>0$, there exist $s \in S$ such that 
$$
|x - s| < \e \,.
$$

:::


In other words, the above definition is saying that $S$ and $\R$ are tightly knitted together. An equivalent definition of dense set is 
given below.


::: Remark
Let $S \subseteq \R$. They are equivalent: 

- $S$ is dense in $\R$.
- For every pair of numbers $x,y \in \R$ with $x<y$, there exists $s \in S$ such that
$$
x < s < y \,.
$$

:::



We now prove that $\Q$ is dense in $\R$. 



::: Theorem 
### Density of $\Q$ in $\R$    {#theorem-density}

Let $x,y \in \R$, with $x<y$. There exists $q \in \Q$ such that
$$
x < q < y \,.
$$

![Let $n \in \N$ be such that $1/n< y-x$. Then take $m$ so that $m/n \in (x,y)$.](/images/density_proof.png){#fig-density-proof width=80%}



::: Proof


We need to find $q \in \Q$ such that 
$$
x < q < y \,.
$${#eq-proof-density-1}
By definition of $\Q$, we have that $q$ has to be of the form $q=m/n$ for $m \in \Z$ and $n \in \N$. 
Therefore (@eq-proof-density-1) is equivalent to finding $m \in \Z$ and $n \in \N$ such that
$$
x < \frac{m}{n} < y \,.
$${#eq-proof-density-2}
The idea is to proceed as in @fig-density-proof: We take $n$ such that $1/n$ is small enough,
so that we can make $m$ *jumps* of size $1/n$ and end up between $x$ and $y$.  
To this end, note that $y - x >0$ by assumption. By the Archimedean Property in Theorem \ref{theorem-archimedean} Point 2, there exists $n \in \N$ be such that
$$
\frac{1}{n} < y - x \,.
$${#eq-proof-density-3}
Take $m \in \Z$ such that
$$
m-1 \leq nx < m \,.
$${#eq-proof-density-4}

> Why does such $m$ exist? As $nx>0$, by Archimedean Property in Theorem \ref{theorem-archimedean} Point 1, there exists $m' \in \Z$ such that 
$$
nx < m'
$$ 
We can then choose $m$ to be the smallest element in $\Z$ such that 
$$
nx < m \,.
$${#eq-proof-density-4-bis}
It then follows that
$$
m-1 < nx < m \,.
$$
Indeed, if by contradiction 
$$
m - 1 \geq nx \,,
$$
then $m-1$ would be another integer such that (@eq-proof-density-4-bis) holds. Since $m-1<m$, this contradicts minimality of $m$.

The second inequality in (@eq-proof-density-4) implies 
$$
x < \frac{m}{n} \,,
$$
which is the first inequality in (@eq-proof-density-2). Now note that (@eq-proof-density-3) is equivalent to 
$$
x < y - \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$ 
We can use the above, and the first inequality in (@eq-proof-density-4)
to estimate
\begin{align*}
m & \leq 1 + nx \\
  & < 1 + n \left(   y - \frac{1}{n}  \right ) \\
  & = ny \,,
\end{align*}
which yields
$$
\frac{m}{n} < y \,.
$$
Therefore the second inequality in (@eq-proof-density-2) is proven, concluding the proof.

:::


We have constructed the real numbers $\R$ so that they would fill the **gaps** of $\Q$. Formally, these gaps are the numbers in $\R \smallsetminus \Q$. Let us give a name to this set.

::: Definition
### Irrational numbers

The set of **irrational numbers** in $\R$ is
$$
\mathcal{I} := \R \smallsetminus \Q \,.
$$

:::


::: Question

How many gaps does $\Q$ have? In other words, how many irrational numbers are out there?

:::

The answer is quite surprising, and is a corollary of the density result of Theorem \ref{theorem-density}: The irrational numbers are dense in $\R$.



::: Corollary

Let $x,y \in \R$, with $x<y$. There exists $t \in \mathcal{I}$ such that
$$
x < t < y \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof 

Consider 
$$
\widetilde{x}:=x - \sqrt{2}\,, \quad \widetilde{y} :=y - \sqrt{2} \,.
$$
Since $x<y$, we have
$$
\widetilde{x} < \widetilde{y} \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-density} there exists $q \in \Q$ such that
$$
\widetilde{x} < q < \widetilde{y} \,.
$$
Adding $\sqrt{2}$ to the above inequalities we get
$$
x < t < y \,, \quad t := q + \sqrt{2} \,.
$${#eq-density-proof}
We claim that $t \in \mathcal{I}$. Indeed, suppose by contradiction $t \in \Q$. Then 
$$
\sqrt{2} = t - q \in \Q\,,
$$
since $t,q \in \Q$, and $\Q$ is closed under summation. Since $\sqrt{2} \in \mathcal{I}$, we obtain a contradiction. Thus $t \in \mathcal{I}$ and
(@eq-density-proof) is our thesis.
:::




## Cardinality


We have proven that the sets or rational numbers $\Q$ and irrational numbers $\mathcal{I}$ are 
both dense in $\R$, with 
$$
\R = \Q \cup \mathcal{I} \,.
$$
From this result we might think that $\R$ is obtained by mixing $\Q$ and $\mathcal{I}$ in 
equal proportions. This is however false. We will see that $\R$ has much more elements
than $\Q$. Therefore also the set of irrational numbers $\mathcal{I}$ is much larger than $\Q$.


To make the above discussion precise, we need to introduce the *size* of a set. For this, we need the concept of bijective function.


::: Definition
### Bijective function

Let $X,Y$ be sets and $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. We say that:

1. $f$ is **injective** if it holds:
$$
f(x)=f(y) \quad \implies \quad x = y \,.
$$

2. $f$ is **surjective** if it holds:
$$
\forall \, y \in Y \,, \,\, \exists \, x \in X \st f(x) = y \,.
$$

3. $f$ is **bijective** if it is both **injective** and **surjective**.

:::



In other words: A function $f \colon X \to Y$ is:

1. Injective if any two different elements in $X$ are mapped into two different elements in $Y$.
2. Surjective if every element in $Y$ has at least one element in $X$ associated via $f$.
3. Bijective if to each element in $X$ we associate one and only one element in $Y$ via $f$.



::: Example
### Injectivity

Consider the sets
$$
X = \{ 1, 2, 3 \} \,, \quad  
Y = \{ a,b,c,d,e\} \,.
$$

1. The function $f \colon X \to Y$ defined by
$$
f(1)=c \,, \quad f(2) = a \,, \quad f(3) = e \,,
$$
is injective. 

2. The function $g \colon X \to Y$ defined by
$$
g(1)=c \,, \quad g(2) = a \,, \quad g(3) = c \,,
$$
is not injective, since 
$$
g(1) = g(3) = c \,, \quad 1 \neq 3 \,.
$$

3. The function $h \colon \R \to \R$ defined by 
$$
h(x) = x^2

$$

4. The function $l \colon \R \to \R$ defined by 
$$
l(x) = 2x

l(x) = l(y) \quad \implies \quad 2x = 2y \quad \implies \quad x = y \,.
$$

$$
g(x) = b \,.
$$

3. The function $h \colon \R \to \R$ defined by 
$$
h(x) = x^2
$$
is not surjective, since there is no $x \in \R$ such that 
$$
h(x) =  x^2 = -1  \,.
$$

4. The function $l \colon \R \to [0 , \infty)$ defined by 
$$
l(x) = x^2
$$
is surjective, since for every $y \geq 0$ there exists $x \in \R$ such that
$$
l(x)= x^2 = y\,.

This is true by Theorem \ref{theorem_existence_root}.

:::



We are ready to define the *size* of a set.


::: Definition
### Cardinality, Finite, Countable, Uncountable

Let $X$ be a set. The **cardinality** of $X$ is the number of elements in $X$. We denote
the cardinality of $X$ by
$$
|X| := \# \, \mbox{ of elements in } \, X \,.
$$
Further, we say that:

1. $X$ is **finite** if there exists a natural number $n \in \N$ and a bijection
$$
f \colon X \to \{1,2,\ldots, n \} \,.
$$
In particular 
$$
|X| = n \,.
$$

2. $X$ is **countable** if there exists a bijection
$$
f \colon X \to \N \,.
$$
In this case we denote the cardinality of $X$ by
$$
|X| = |\N| \,.
$$

3. $X$ is **uncountable** if $X$ is neither finite, nor countable.

:::


In other words, A set $X$ is:

1. Finite, if $X$ can be listed as
$$
X = \{ x_1 , \ldots, x_n \}
$$
for some $n \in \N$.

2. Countable, if $X$ can be listed as
$$
X = \{ x_n \divider n \in \N  \} \,.
$$

3. Uncountable, if $X$ cannot be listed.




::: Question

Is there an intermediate cardinality between finite and countable? 

:::

The answer is no, as shown in the next proposition.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-countable-subset}

Let $X$ be a countable set and $A \subseteq X$. Then either $A$ is finite or countable.

:::

::: Proof

If $A$ is finite, there is nothing to prove. Therefore suppose $A$ is not finite.
Since $X$ is countable there exists a bijection $f \colon \N \to X$.
Let $n_1 \in \N$ be such that
$$
n_1 = \min \{ n \in \N \st f(n) \in A \} \,.
$$
Note that $n_1$ exists since $f$ is surjective.
Define 
$$
g(1) := f(n_1) \,.
$$
Now let 
$$
n_2 = \min \{ n  \in \N \st n > n_1 \,, \,\, f(n) \in A \} \,.
$$
Notice that $n_2$ exists, since $f$ is surjective and $A$ is not finite. Set
$$
g(2):=f(n_2) \,.
$$
Iterating, we define
$$
n_k = \min \{ n \in \N \st n>n_{k-1} \,, \,\, f(n) \in A \}
$$
and 
$$
g(k) := f(n_k) \,.
$$
In this way we have defined a function $g \colon \N \to A$. We have:

- $g$ is injective: This is because $g$ was defined thourgh $f$, and $f$ is injective.
- $g$ is surjective: If $x \in A$, by surjectivity of $f$ there exists $\widetilde{n} \in \N$ such 
that $f(\widetilde{n})=x$. Therefore
$$
\widetilde{n} \in  \{ n \in \N \st f(n) \in A \} \,,
$$
so that $n_k= \widetilde{n}$, for some $k \geq \widetilde{n}-1$.


Hence $g$ is bijective, showing that $A$ is countable.

:::




::: Example


1. Let $X = \{a,b,c\}$ and $Y=\{ 1,2,3\}$. The function $f \colon X \to Y$ defined by
$$
f(1)=a \,, \quad f(2) = b \,, \quad f(3) = c \,,
$$
is bijective. Therefore $X$ is finite, with $|X| = 3$.

2. Let $X = \N$. The function $f \colon X \to \N$ defined by
$$
f(n):=n \,,
$$
is bijective. Therefore $X = \N$ is countable.

3. Let $X$ be the set of even numbers
$$
X = \{ 2n \divider n \in \N \} \,.
$$
Define the map $f \colon X \to \N$ by
$$
f(m):= \frac{m}{2} \,.
$$
We have that:

    - $f$ is injective: $f(m)=f(k)$ implies that $m/2=k/2$ which implies $m=k$.
    - $f$ is surjective: If $n \in \N$, then $f(2n)=n$.
    
    Therefore $f$ is bijective, showing that $X$ is countable and $|X|=|\N|$.

4. Let $X = \Z$ the set of integers. Define $f \colon \N \to \Z$ by 
$$
f(n):= 
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{n}{2}  & \,\, \mbox{ if } \, n \, \mbox{ even }  \\
-\dfrac{n+1}{2}  & \,\, \mbox{ if } \, n \, \mbox{ odd }  
\end{cases}
$$
For example
\begin{align*}
f(0) & = 0 \,, \quad f(1) = -1 \,, \quad f(2) = 1 \,, \quad f(3) = -2 \,, \\
f(4) & = 2 \,, \quad f(5) = -3 \,, \quad f(6) = 3 \,, \quad f(7) = -4 \,.
\end{align*}
We have:

    - $f$ is injective: Indeed, suppose that $m \neq n$. If $n$ and $m$ are both even or both odd we have, respectively
    \begin{align*}
    f(m) = \frac{m}{2} & \neq \frac{n}{2} = f(n)  \\
    f(m) =  -\frac{m+1}{2} & \neq  - \frac{n+1}{2} = f(n) \,.
    \end{align*}
    If instead $m$ is even and $n$ is odd, we get
    $$
    f(m) = \frac{m}{2} \neq  - \frac{n+1}{2} = f(n)  \,,
    $$
    since the LHS is positive and the RHS is negative. The case when $m$ is odd and $n$ even is 
    similar.  

    - $f$ is surjective: Let $z \in \Z$. If $z \geq 0$, then $m:=2z$ belongs to $\N$, is even, and
    $$
    f(m) = f(2z) = z \,.
    $$
    If instead $z < 0$, then $m := -2z -1$ belongs to $\N$, is odd, and
    $$
    f(m) = f(-2z-1) = z \,.
    $$
    
   Therefore $f$ is bijective, showing that $\Z$ is countable and
   $$
   |\Z| =| \N| \,. 
   $$

:::




We have seen that the sets $\N$ and $\Z$ are countable. What about $\Q$?
To study this case, we need the following result.




:::  {.Proposition  #proposition-countable-union}

Let the set $A_n$ be countable for all $n \in \N$. Define
$$
A = \bigcup_{n \in \N} \, A_n \, .
$$
Then $A$ is countable.

:::

::: Proof

Since each $A_i$ is countable, we 
can list their elements as
$$
A_i = \{ a_k^i \divider k \in \N  \} = \{   a_1^i , \, a_2^i , \, a_3^i , \, a_4^i , \, \ldots \} \,.
$$
The proof that $A$ is countable is based on a diagonal argument by
Georg Cantor, see [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor's_diagonal_argument0). 
The idea is that we can list the elements of the sets
$A_i$ in an infinite square: In the first row we put the elements
of $A_1$, in the second row the elements of $A_2$, and so on. Therefore
the $i$-th row contains the elements of $A_i$. This procedure is 
illustrated in @fig-diagonal-argument.
Therefore this infinite square contains all the elements of $A$.
We then list all the elements of the square by looking at the diagonals, as shown in @fig-diagonal-argument. This procedure 
defines a function $f \colon \N \to A$. For example the first few terms
of $f$ are
$$
f(1) = a_1^1 \,, \quad f(2) = a_2^1 \,, \quad f(3) = a_1^2 \,, \quad 
f(4) = a_1^3 \,.
$$
Since $f$ is injective and surjective, we have that $A$ is countable.

is a bijection. As $\Z$ is countable, we deduce that $L_i$ is 
countable. Therefore the set $L$ defined by
$$
L:= \bigcup_{i \in \N} \, L_i
$$
is countable by Proposition \ref{proposition-countable-union}. Clearly
we have
$$
\Q \subseteq L \,.
$$
Since $\Q$ is not finite, by Proposition \ref{proposition-countable-subset} we conclude that $\Q$ is countable.

We have proven that the sets
$$
\N \,, \quad \Z \,, \quad \Q \,,
$$
are all countable. What about $\R$?


::: Theorem
### $\R$ is uncountable  {#theorem-R-uncountable}

The set of Real Numbers $\R$ is **uncountable**.

:::



::: Proof

Suppose by contradiction $\R$ is countable. Then there exists a bijection $f \colon \N \to \R$, meaning that we can list the elements of $\R$ as
$$
\R = \{ x_1 , x_2 , x_3 , x_4 , x_5 , \ldots \} \,.
$$
Let $I_1$ be a closed interval such that
$$
x_1 \notin I_1 \,.
$$
Let $I_2$ be another closed interval, contained in $I_1$, and such 
that $x_2 \notin I_2$. Such interval exists, because $I_1$ contains
two disjoint closed intervals: hence $x_2$ can be at most in one of these
two intervals. To summarize, we have
$$
x_1 \notin I_1 \,, \quad x_2 \notin I_2 \,, \quad I_2 \subseteq I_1 \,.
$$
We can iterate this procedure, and construct a sequence of nested
intervals $I_n$ such that
$$
I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n \,, \quad  x_n \notin I_n \,,
$$
for all $n \in \N$, see @fig-R-uncountable. Since $x_k \notin I_k$, we 
conclude that
$$
x_k \notin \bigcap_{n =1}^\infty \, I_n \,, \quad \forall \, k \in \N \,.
$$
As the points $x_k$ are all the elements of $\R$, we conclude that
$$
\bigcap_{n =1}^\infty \, I_n = \emptyset \,.
$$
However the Nested Interval Property of Theorem \ref{theorem-nested} implies that 
$$
\bigcap_{n =1}^\infty \, I_n \neq \emptyset \,,
$$
yielding a contradiction. Therefore $\R$ is uncountable.

As a corollary we obtain that also the irrational numbers are 
uncountable.


::: Theorem

The set of irrational numbers 
$$
\mathcal{I}:=\R \smallsetminus \Q
$$
is uncountable.

:::


::: Proof

In Theorems \ref{theorem-Q-countable}, \ref{theorem-R-uncountable} we have shown that $\R$ in uncountable and $\Q$ is countable. Suppose by contradiction that $\mathcal{I}$ is countable. Then
$$
\Q \cup \mathcal{I} 
$$
is countable by Proposition \ref{proposition-countable-union}, being union of countable sets. Since by definition
$$
\R = \Q \cup \mathcal{I} \,,
$$
we conclude that $\R$ is countable. Contradiction.
