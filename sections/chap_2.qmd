# Preliminaries

Before introducing $\R$ we want to make sure that we cover all the basics needed for the task.



## Sets

A sets is a **collection** of objects. These objects are called **elements** of the set. For example in the previous section we mentioned the following sets:

- $\N$ the set of natural numbers
- $\Z$ the set of integers
- $\Q$ the set of rational numbers
- $\R$ the set of real numbers

Given an arbitrary set $A$, we write 
$$
x \in A
$$ 

if the element $x$ belongs to the set $A$. If an element $x$ is not contained in $A$, we say that 

$$
x \notin A \,.
$$

::: Remark

A set can contain all sorts of elements. For example the students in a classroom can be modelled by a set $S$. The elements of the set are the students. For example

$$
S = \{ 
    \text{Alice, Olivia, Jake, Sahab}   
     \}
$$

In this case we have

$$
\text{Alice} \in S 
$$
but instead

$$
\text{Silvio} \notin S \,. 
$$

## Logic

In this section we introduce some basic logic symbols. Suppose that you are given two statements, say $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The formula
$$
\alpha \implies \beta
$$
means that $\alpha$ **implies** $\beta$. In other words, if $\alpha$ is true then also $\beta$ is true.  
The formula
$$
\alpha \impliedby \beta
$$
means that $\alpha$ is implied by $\beta$: if $\beta$ is true then also $\alpha$ is true.  
When we write
$$
\alpha \iff \beta
$$ {#eq-iff}
we mean that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are **equivalent**. Note that (@eq-iff) is equivalent to 
$$
\alpha \implies \beta  \,\, \text{ and } \,\,
\beta \implies \alpha \,.
$$
Such equivalence is very useful in proofs.

::: Example
We have that 
$$
x > 0 \implies x>-100 \,,
$$
and 
$$
\text{ contradiction }   \impliedby  \sqrt{2} \in \Q \,.
$$
Concerning $\iff$ we have
$$
x^2 < 2  \iff  - \sqrt{2} < x < \sqrt{2} \,.
$$
:::

We now introduce logic **quantifiers**. These are 

* $\forall$ which reads **for all**
* $\exists$ which reads **exists**
* $\exists !$ which reads **exists unique**
* $\not\exists$ which reads **does not exists**

These work in the following way. Suppose that you are given a statement $\alpha(x)$ which depends on the point $x \in \R$. Then we say 

* $\alpha(x)$ is satisfied for all $x \in A$ with $A$ some collection of numbers. This translates to the symbols
$$
\alpha(x) \, \text{ is true } \, \forall \, x \in A \,,
$$
* There exists some $x$ in $\R$ such that $\alpha(x)$ is satisfied: in symbols
$$
\exists \, x \in \R \, \text{ such that } \, \alpha(x) \, \text{ is true},
$$
* There exists a unique $x_0$ in $\R$ such that $\alpha(x)$ is satisfied: in symbols
$$
\exists ! \, x_0 \in \R \, \text{ such that } \, \alpha(x_0) \, \text{ is true},
$$
* $\alpha(x)$ is never satisfied: 
$$
\not\exists  \, x \in \R \, \text{ such that } \, \alpha(x) \, \text{ is true}.
$$


::: Example

Let us make concrete examples:

* The expression $x^2$ is always non-negative. Thus we can say
$$
x^2 \geq 0 \,\, \text{ for all } \,\, x \in \R \,.
$$
* The equation $x^2=1$ has two solutions $x=1$ and $x=-1$. Therefore we can say
$$
\exists \, x \in \R \, \text{such that } \, x^2  = 1 \,. 
$$
* The equation $x^3=1$ has a unique solution $x=1$. Thus
$$
\exists ! \, x \in \R \, \text{such that } \, x^3  = 1 \,. 
$$
* We know that the equation $x^2=2$ has no solutions in $\Q$. Then
$$
\not\exists  \, x \in \Q \, \text{such that } \, x^2  = 2 \,. 
$$

## Operations on sets

### Union and intersection

For two sets $A$ and $B$ we define their **union** as the set
$$
A \cup B := \{ x\, \colon \, x \in A  \, \text{ or } \, x \in B \} \,.
$$
The **intersection** of $A$ and $B$ is defined by
$$
A \cap B := \{ x\, \colon \, x \in A  \, \text{ and } \, x \in B \} \,.
$$
We denote the **empty set** by the symbol $\emptyset$. Two sets are **disjoint** if 
$$
A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$

::: Example

Define the subset of rational numbers
$$
S:= \left\{ x \in \Q \, \colon \, 0 < x < \frac52 \right\} \,.
$$
Then we have 
$$
\N \cap S = \{1, 2 \} \,.
$$
We can also define the sets of **even** and **odd** numbers by 

\begin{align}
E & := \{ 2n \, \colon \, n \in \N \} \,,\\
O & := \{ 2n+1 \, \colon \, n \in \N \} \,.
\end{align}

Then we have

\begin{align}
\N \cap E & = E \,, \,\, \N \cap O = O \,, \\
O \cup E & = \N \,, \,\, O \cap D = \emptyset \,.
\end{align}

:::




### Inclusion and equality


Given two sets $A$ and $B$, we say that $A$ is **contained** in $B$ if all the elements of $A$ are also contained in $B$. This will be denoted with the **inclusion** symbol $\subseteq$, that is,
$$
A \subseteq B \,.
$$
In this case we say that 

- $A$ is a **subset** of $B$, 
- $B$ is a **superset** of $A$.

The inclusion $A \subseteq B$ is equivalent to the implication:
$$
x \in A \,\, \implies \,\, x \in B 
$$
for all $x \in A$. The symbol $\implies$ reads **implies**, and denotes the fact that the first condition implies the second.


::: Example

Given two sets $A$ and $B$ we always have
\begin{gather}
(A \cap B) \subseteq A \,, \,\, (A \cap B) \subseteq B \,,\\
A \subseteq (A \cup B) \,, \,\, B \subseteq (A \cup B) \,.
\end{gather}

:::


We say that two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal if they contain the **same** elements. We denote equality by the symbol
$$
A=B \,.
$$
If $A \subseteq B$ and $A \neq B$, we write
$$
A \subset B \quad \mbox{ or } \quad A \subsetneq B \,.
$$



::: Example

1. The sets 
$$
A =\{ 1,2,3 \} \,, \quad B= \{ 3 ,1,2\}
$$
are equal, that is $A=B$. This is because they contain exactly the same elements: **order** does not matter when talking about sets. 

2. Consider the sets
$$
A =\{ 1,2 \} \,, \quad B = \{ 1, 2 ,5 \} \,.
$$
Then $A$ is contained in $B$, but $A$ is not equal to $B$. Therefore
we write $A \subset B$ or $A \subsetneq B$.

:::

::: {.Proposition #Proposition-Equality-Sets}

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Then 
$$
A=B
$$
**if and only if**
$$
A \subseteq B \,\, \text{ and } \,\, B \subseteq A \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof
The proof is almost trivial. However it is a good exercise in basic logic, so let us do it. 


1. First implication $\implies$:  
Suppose that $A=B$. Let us show that $A\subseteq B$. Since $A = B$, this means that all the elements of $A$ are also contained in $B$. Therefore if we take $x \in A$ we have
$$
x \in A \,\, \implies \,\, x \in B \,.
$$
This shows $A \subseteq B$. The proof of $B \subseteq A$ is similar. 

2. Second implication $\impliedby$:  
Suppose that $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$. We need to show $A=B$, that is, $A$ and $B$ have the same elements. To this end let $x \in A$. Since $A \subseteq B$ then we have $x \in B$. Thus $B$ contains all the elements of $A$. Since we are also assuming $B \subseteq A$, this means that $A$ contains all the elements of $B$. Hence $A$ and $B$ contain the same elements, and $A=B$.

:::


The above proposition is very useful when we need to **prove** that two sets are equal: rather than showing directly that $A = B$, we can prove that $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$. 




### Infinite unions and intersections

Suppose given a set $\Omega$, and a family of sets $A_n \subseteq \Omega$, where $n \in \N$. Then we can define the **infinte union**
$$
\bigcup_{n \in \N} A_n := \{ x \in \Omega \, \colon \, x \in A_n \,\, \text{ for at least one } \,\, n \in \N \} \,.
$$
The **infinte intersection** is defined as
$$
\bigcap_{n \in \N} A_n := \{ x \in \Omega \, \colon \, x \in A_n \,\, \text{ for all } \,\, n \in \N \} \,.
$$

::: Example 

Let the ambient set be $\Omega:=\N$ and define the family $A_n$ by
\begin{align}
A_1 & := \{ 1, 2, 3 , 4 , \ldots \} \\
A_2 & := \{ 2, 3 , 4 , 5, \ldots \} \\
A_3 & := \{ 3 , 4 , 5, 6, \ldots \} \\
& \ldots \ldots  \\
A_n & := \{ n, n+1, n+2, n+3,  \ldots \} \,,
\end{align}
for arbitrary $n \in \N$. Then
$$
\bigcup_{n \in \N} A_n = \N \,.
$$ {#eq-infinite-union}
The above equality can be easily proven using Proposition \ref{Proposition-Equality-Sets}. Indeed, assume that $m \in \cup_n A_n$. Then $m \in A_n$ for at least one $n \in \N$. Since $A_n \subseteq \N$, we conclude that $m \in \N$. This shows 
$$
\bigcup_{n \in \N} A_n \subseteq \N \,.
$$
Conversely, suppose that $m \in \N$. By definition $m \in A_m$. Hence there exists at least one index $n$, $n=m$ in this case, such that $m \in A_n$. Then by definition $m \in \cup_{n \in \N} A_n$, showing that
$$
\N \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \N} A_n \,.
$$
Hence we conclude (@eq-infinite-union) by Proposition \ref{Proposition-Equality-Sets}.  
We also have that
$$
\bigcap_{n \in \N} A_n = \emptyset \,.
$$ {#eq-infinite-intersection}
We prove the above by **contradiction**. Indeed, suppose that (@eq-infinite-intersection) is false, i.e., 
$$
\bigcap_{n \in \N} A_n \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
This means there exists some $m \in \N$ such that $m \in \cap_{n \in \N} A_n$. Hence, by definition, $m \in A_n$ for all $n \in \N$. However $m \notin A_{m+1}$, yielding a contradiction. Thus (@eq-infinite-intersection) holds.
:::




### Complement

Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of a larger set $\Omega$. The **complement** of $A$ with respect to $B$ is the set of elements of $B$ which do not belong to $A$, that is
$$
B \smallsetminus A := \{ x \in \Omega \, \colon \, x \in B \, \text{ and } \, x \notin A \} \,.
$$
In particular, the complement of $A$ with respect to $\Omega$ is denoted by 
$$
A^c := \Omega \smallsetminus A := \{ x \in \Omega \, \colon \, x \notin A \} \,.
$$


::: Remark

Suppose that $A \subseteq \Omega$. Then $A$ and $A^c$ form a **partition** of $\Omega$, in the sense that
$$
A \cup A^c = \Omega  \,\, \text{ and } \,\,  A \cap A^c = \emptyset \,.
$$

:::

::: Example

Suppose $A, B \subseteq \Omega$. Then
$$
A \subseteq B  \iff B^c \subseteq A^c \,.
$$

Let us prove the above claim:

- First implication $\implies$:  
Suppose that $A \subseteq B$. We need to show that $B^c \subseteq A^c$. Hence, assume $x \in B^c$. By definition this means that $x \notin B$. Now notice that we cannot have that $x \in A$. Indeed, assume $x \in A$.  By assumption we have $A \subseteq B$, hence $x \in B$. But we had assumed $x \in B$, contradiction. Therefore it must be that $x \notin A$. Thus $B^c \subseteq A^c$.

- Second implication $\impliedby$:  
Essentially the same proof, hence we omit it.  
:::

We conclude by stating the De Morgan's Laws. The proof will be left as an exercise.

::: Proposition
## De Morgan's Laws

Suppose $A,B \subseteq \Omega$. Then
$$
(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c 
$$
and
$$
(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c  \,.
$$ 

:::




### Power set

Let $\Omega$ be an arbitray set. We define the **power set** of $\Omega$ as 
$$
\mathcal{P}(\Omega) := \{ A \divider A \subseteq \Omega \}\,,
$$
that is, the power set of $\Omega$ is the set of all subsets of $\Omega$. 


::: Remark
It holds that:

1. $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ is always non-empty, since we have that 
$$
\emptyset \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \,,  \quad  \Omega \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \,.
$$
2. Given $A, B \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$, then the sets
$$
A \cup B, \quad  A \cap B ,\quad A^c , \quad B \smallsetminus A 
$$
are all elements of $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$.
3. Suppose $\Omega$ is **discrete** and **finite**, that is,
$$
\Omega = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}
$$
for some $m \in \N$. Then $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ contains $2^m$ elements. 
    
    >This is because for each $x_i \in \Omega$ we have just two choices: either include $x_i$ in a subset, or do not include $x_i$ in a subset.
:::


::: Example
Define the set
$$
\Omega = \{ x, y, z \}\,.
$$
Then $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ has $2^3 = 8$ elements. These are

- $\emptyset$
- $\{x\}$
- $\{y\}$
- $\{z\}$
- $\{x,y\}$
- $\{x,z\}$
- $\{y,z\}$
- $\{x,y,z\}$

We therefore write 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{P}(\Omega) = \{ \emptyset, & \, \{x\} , \,  \{y\} , \, \{z\} , \{x,y\} \\
&  \{x,z\}, \, \{y,z\} , \, \{x,y,z\} \} \,. 
\end{align}
:::


### Product of sets

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two sets. The **product** of $A$ and $B$ is the set of pairs
$$
A \times B := \{ (a,b) \, \colon \, a \in A, \, b \in B \} \,.
$$
By definition two elements in $A \times B$ are the same, in symbols
$$
(a, b) = (\tilde{a}, \tilde{b})
$$
if and only if they are equal component-by-componenent, that is
$$
a=\tilde{a}\,, \qquad b = \tilde{b} \,.
$$




## Equivalence relation


Suppose $A$ is a set. A **binary relation** $R$ on $A$ is a subset 
$$
R \subseteq A \times A \,.
$$

::: Definition
### Equivalence relation

A binary relation $R$ is called an **equivalence relation** if it satisfies the following properties:

1. **Reflexive**: For each $x \in A$ one has 
$$
(x,x) \in R \,, 
$$

    > This is saying that all the elements in $A$ must be related to themselves

2. **Symmetric**: We have
$$
(x,y) \in R \implies (y,x) \in R
$$

    > If $x$ is related to $y$, then $y$ is related to $x$

3. **Transitive**: We have
$$
(x,y) \in R \,, \,\, (y,z) \in R  \implies (x,z) \in R 
$$

    > If $x$ is related to $y$, and $y$ is related to $z$, then $x$ must be related to $z$


If $(x,y) \in R$ we write
$$
x \sim y 
$$
and we say that $x$ and $y$ are **equivalent**.
:::





::: Definition
### Equivalence classes

Suppose $R$ is an **equivalence relation** on $A$. The **equivalence class** of an element $x \in A$ is the set
$$
[x]:=\{ y \in A \, \colon \, y \sim x \} \,.
$$
The set of equivalence classes of elements of $A$ with respect to the equivalence relation $R$ is denoted by 
$$
A / R \, :=  \,\{ [x] \, \colon \, x \in A \} \,.
$$


:::


Let us immediately clarify the above definitions by considering the prototypical example of equivalence relation: the **equality**.


::: Example
### Equality is an equivalence relation

Consider the set of natural numbers $\N$. The equality defines a **binary relation** on $\N \times \N$, via
$$
R:=\{ (x,y) \in \N \times \N \, \colon \, x=y  \} \,.
$$
Let us check that $R$ is an **equivalence relation**:

1. Reflexive: It holds, since $x=x$ for all $x \in \N$,

2. Symmetric: Again $x = y$ if and only if $y = x$,

3. Transitive: If $x = y$ and $y = z$ then $x = z$.

The class of equivalence of $x \in \N$ is given by
$$
[x] = \{ x \}\,,
$$
that is, this relation is quite trivial, given that each element of $\N$ can only be related to itself. The quotient space is then 
$$
\N / R = \{ [x] \divider x \in \N \} = \{  \{ x\} \divider x \in \N \}  \,.
$$
:::




::: Example
Suppose that $R$ is a binary relation on the set $\Q$ of rational numbers defined by
$$
x \sim y  \iff x-y \in \Z \,.
$$
Then $R$ is an equivalence relation on $\Q$. Indeed:

1. Reflexive: Let $x \in \Q$. Then $x-x = 0$ and $0 \in \Z$. Thus $x \sim x$.
2. Symmetric: If $x \sim y$ then $x-y \in \Z$. But then also  
$$
-(x-y) = y - x \in \Z
$$
and so $y \sim x$.
3. Transitive: Suppose $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$. Then 
$$
x - y \in \Z \,  \text{ and } \, y - z \in \Z \,.
$$
Thus we have
$$
x-z = (x-y) + (y-z) \in \Z
$$
showing that $x \sim z$. This shows that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $\Q$.


Now note that 
$$
y \sim x \iff y -x \in \Z 
$$
and the above is equivalent to
$$
\exists \, n \in \Z \, \text{ s.t. } \, y - x = n
$$
which again is equivalent to 
$$
\exists \, n \in \Z \, \text{ s.t. } \, y = x + n \,.
$$
Therefore all the elements of $\Q$ related to $x$ by $R$ are of the form 
$$
x + n \,, \, \forall \, n \in \Z \,.
$$
The equivalence classes with respect to $R$ are then
$$
 [x] = \{  x + n \ \colon \ n \in \Z  \}  \,.
$$
Each equivalence class has exactly one element in $[0,1) \cap \Q$, meaning that:
$$
\forall x \in \Q \,, \,\, \exists! \, q \in \Q \st  0 \leq q < 1 \, \text{ and } \, q \in [x]\,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\Q / R = \{ [x] \divider x \in \Q \} = \{ q \in \Q \divider 0 \leq q <1  \} \,.
$$
:::





## Order relation

Similarly, we define **order relations**.


::: Definition
### Partial order

A binary relation $R$ on $A$ is called a **partial order** if it satisfies the following properties:

1. **Reflexive**: For each $x \in A$ one has 
$$
(x,x) \in R \,, 
$$

2. **Transitive**: We have
$$
(x,y) \in R \,, \,\, (y,z) \in R  \implies (x,z) \in R 
$$


3. **Antisymmetric**: We have
$$
(x,y) \in R \,  \text{ and } \, (y,x) \in R \implies x = y 
$$

    > This is the only new condition with respect to the definition of equivalence relation, and it replaces symmetry.
:::




:::  Definition
### Total order

A binary relation $R$ on $A$ is called a **total order relation** if it satisfies the following properties:

1. **Partial order**: $R$ is a partial order on $A$.
2. **Total**: For each $x,y \in A$ we have
$$
(x, y) \in R \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, (y,x) \in R \,.
$$

    > This is saying that all elements in $A$ are related.
:::




An example of partial order is the operation of **set inclusion**.

::: Example
### Set inclusion is a partial order

Consider an arbitrary non-empty set $\Omega$ and consider its **power set**
$$
\mathcal{P}(\Omega) = \{ A \divider A \subseteq \Omega  \}\,.
$$
The inclusion defines **binary relation** on $\mathcal{P}(\Omega) \times \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$, via
$$
R:=\{ (A,B) \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \times \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \, \colon \, A \subseteq B  \} \,.
$$
Let us check that $R$ is an **order relation**:

1. Reflexive: It holds, since $A \subseteq A$ for all $A \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$,

2. Transitive: If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$, then by definition of inclusion $A \subseteq C$.

3. Antisymmetric: If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$, then $A=B$ by Proposition \ref{Proposition-Equality-Sets}.

Therefore $R$ is a **partial order** on $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. Note that in general $R$ is **not** a total order. For example if we consider
$$
\Omega = \{x, y\}\,.
$$
Thus
$$
\mathcal{P}(\Omega)  = \{ \emptyset , \, \{x\} , \, \{y\} , \, \{x,y\} \}\,.
$$
If we pick $A=\{x\}$ and $B=\{y\}$ then $A \cap B = \emptyset$, meaning that 
$$
A \not\subseteq B \,, \quad  B \not\subseteq A \,,
$$
showing that $R$ is not a total order.
:::







A very important example of total order is the **inequality** on $\Q$.


::: Example
### Inequality is a total order

Consider the set of rationals $\Q$. The usual inequality defines a **binary relation** on $\Q \times \Q$, via
$$
R:=\{ (x,y) \in \Q \times \Q \, \colon \, x \leq y  \} \,.
$$
Let us check that $R$ is an **order relation**:

1. Reflexive: It holds, since $x \leq x$ for all $x \in \Q$,

2. Transitive: If $x \leq y$ and $y \leq z$ then $x \leq z$.

3. Antisymmetric: If $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$  then $x = y$.

Finally, we halso have that $R$ is a **total order** on $\Q$, since for all $x,y \in \Q$ we have
$$
x \leq y \,\, \text{ or } \,\, y \leq x \,.
$$
:::




::: Notation
If $\Omega$ is a set and $R$ is a total order on $\Omega$, we write
$$
(x,y) \in R  \, \iff \, x \leq y \,. 
$$
Therefore the symbol $\leq$ will always denote a total order relation.
:::





## Intervals

In this section we assume to have available the set $\R$ of **real numbers**, which we recall is an extension of $\Q$. We now introduce the concept of **interval**.

::: Definition

Let $a,b \in \R$ with $a<b$. We define the **open interval** $(a,b)$ as the set
$$
(a,b) := \{ x \in \R \, \colon \, a < x < b \}\,.
$$
We define the **close interval** $[a,b]$ as the set
$$
[a,b] := \{ x \in \R \, \colon \, a \leq x \leq b \}\,.
$$
:::

In general we also define the intervals
\begin{align}
[a,b) & := \{ x \in \R \, \colon \, a \leq x < b \}\,, \\
(a,b] & := \{ x \in \R \, \colon \, a \leq x \leq b \}\,, \\
(a, \infty) & := \{ x \in \R \, \colon \, x > a  \}\,, \\
[a, \infty) & := \{ x \in \R \, \colon \, x \geq a  \}\,, \\
(-\infty, b) & := \{ x \in \R \, \colon \, x < b  \}\,, \\
(-\infty, b] & := \{ x \in \R \, \colon \, x \leq b  \}\,.
\end{align}

Some of the above intervals are depicted in @fig-interval-1, @fig-interval-2, @fig-interval-3, @fig-interval-4 below.

## Functions


::: Definition
### Functions {#definition-function}
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A **function** from $A$ to $B$ is a rule which associates **at each** element $x \in A$ a **single** element $y \in B$. Notations:

- We write 
$$
f \ \colon A \to B
$$ 
to indicate such rule,
- For $x \in A$, we denote by 
$$
y:=f(x) \in B
$$ 
the element associated with $x$ by $f$.
- We will often denote the map $f$ also by
$$
x \mapsto f(x) \,.
$$

In addition:

- The set $A$ is called the **domain** of $f$,
- The **range** of $f$ is the set
$$
\{ y \in B \divider y = f(x) \, \mbox{ for some }\, x \in A \} \subseteq B \,.
$$
:::

::: Warning
We want to stress the importance of the first two sentences in Definition \ref{definition-function}.  Assume that $f \colon A \to B$ is a function. Then:

- To each element $x \in A$ we can **only** associate **one** element $f(x) \in B$,
- Every element $x \in A$ has to be associated to an element $f(x) \in B$.
:::


::: Example
Assume given the two sets 
$$
A = \{ a_1,a_2 \} \,, \quad B=\{b_1,b_2,b_3\} \,.
$$
Let us see a few examples:

- Define $f \ \colon A \to B$ by setting 
$$
f(a_1) = b_1 \,, \quad f(a_2) = b_1 \,.
$$
In this way $f$ is a function, with domain $A$ and range
$$

Then $g$ is **NOT** a function, since the element $a_1$ has two elements associated.

## Absolute value or Modulus

In this section we assume to have available the set $\R$ of **real numbers**, which we recall is an extension of $\Q$. 

::: Definition
### Absolute value 
For $x \in \R$ we define its **absolute value** as the quantity
$$
|x| = 
\begin{cases}
x  & \text{ if } \, x \geq 0 \\
-x  & \text{ if } \, x < 0 
\end{cases}
$$
:::

::: Example

By definition one has $|x|=x$ if $x \geq 0$. For example
$$
|\pi| = \pi \,, \,\, \left|\sqrt{2}\right| = \sqrt{2} \,, \,\, |0|=0 \,.
$$
Instead $|x|= -x$ if $x < 0$. For example 
$$
|-\pi| = \pi \,, \,\, \left|-\sqrt{2}\right| = \sqrt{2} \,, \,\, |-10|=10 \,.
$$
:::


Let us also make the following basic remark, whose proof will be left as an exercise.

::: Remark
For all $x \in \R$ one has 
$$
|x| \geq 0 \,.
$$
Moreover 
$$
|x| = 0 \iff x = 0 \,.
$$
:::

Another basic remark (proof by exercise).

::: {.Remark #rmk-absolute-value-sym}

For all $x \in \R$ one has
$$
|x| = |-x| \,.
$$

:::

We can use the definition of absolute value to define the **absolute value function**. This is the function
$$
f \ \colon \R \to \R \,, \quad f(x):=|x| \,.
$$
You might be familiar with the graph associated to $f$, as seen below.

![Plot of the absolute value function $f(x)=|x|$](/images/absolute_value.png){width=40%}


It is also useful to understand the absolute value in a geometric way.  


::: Remark
### Geometric interpretation of $|x|$
A number $x \in \R$ can be represented with a point on the real line $\R$.The non-negative number $|x|$ represents the **distance** of $x$ from the origin $0$. Notice that this works for both positive and negative numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively, as shown in @fig-absolute-value-1 below.
:::


![Geometric interpretation of $|x|$](/images/absolute_value_1.png){#fig-absolute-value-1 width=70%}



::: Remark
### Geometric interpretation of $|x-y|$

If $x,y \in \R$ then the number $|x-y|$ represents the distance between $x$ and $y$ on the real line, as shown in @fig-absolute-value-2 below.
Note that by Remark \ref{rmk-absolute-value-sym} we have
$$
|x-y| = |y-x| \,.
$$
:::

![Geometric interpretation of $|x-y|$](/images/absolute_value_2.png){#fig-absolute-value-2 width=70%}


In the next Lemma we show a fundamental equivalence regarding the absolute value.

::: {.Lemma #lemma-absolute-value}
Let $x,y \in \R$. Then
$$
|x| \leq y  \iff -y \leq x \leq y \,.
$$
:::

The geometric meaning of the above statement is clear: the distance of $x$ from the origin is less than $y$, in formulae 
$$
|x| \leq y\,,
$$
if and only if $x$ belongs to the interval $[-y,y]$, in formulae
$$
-y \leq x \leq y \,.
$$ 
A sketch of this explanation is seen in @fig-absolute-value-3 below.

![Geometric meaning of Lemma \ref{lemma-absolute-value}](/images/absolute_value_3.png){#fig-absolute-value-3 width=70%}


::: Proof
### Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-absolute-value}


*Step 1: First implication.*  
Suppose first that 
$$
|x| \leq y \,.
$$ {#eq-lemma-absolute-value-1}
Recalling that the absolute value is non-negative, from (@eq-lemma-absolute-value-1) we deduce that $0 \leq |x| \leq y$. In particular it holds 
$$
y \geq 0 \,.
$$ {#eq-lemma-absolute-value-2}
We make separate arguments for the cases $x \geq 0$ and $x<0$:

- Case 1: $x \geq 0$.  From (@eq-lemma-absolute-value-1), (@eq-lemma-absolute-value-2) and from $x \geq 0$ we have
$$
-y \leq 0 \leq x = |x| \leq y
$$
which shows 
$$
-y \leq x \leq y \,.
$$
- Case 2: $x < 0$. From (@eq-lemma-absolute-value-1), (@eq-lemma-absolute-value-2) and from $x < 0$ we have
$$
-y \leq 0 < - x = |x| \leq y
$$
which shows 
$$
-y \leq - x \leq y \,.
$$
Multiplying the above inequalities by $-1$ yields
$$
-y \leq x \leq y \,.
$$

*Step 2: Second implication.*  
Suppose now that  
$$
-y \leq x \leq  y \,.
$$ {#eq-lemma-absolute-value-3}
We make separate arguments for the cases $x \geq 0$ and $x<0$:

- Case 1: $x \geq 0$. Since $x \geq 0$, from (@eq-lemma-absolute-value-3) we get
$$
|x| = x \leq y
$$
showing that 
$$
|x| \leq y \,.
$$
- Case 2: $x < 0$. Since $x < 0$, from (@eq-lemma-absolute-value-3) we have
$$
-y \leq x = - |x| \,.
$$
Multiplying the above inequality by $-1$ yields
$$
|x| \leq y \,.
$$
:::


With the same arguments, just replacing $\leq$ with $<$, one can also show the following.


::: Lemma
Let $x,y \in \R$. Then
$$
|x| < y  \iff -y < x < y \,.
$$
:::




## Triangle inequality

The triangle inequality relates the absolute value to the sum operation. It is a very important inequality, which we will use a lot in the future.

::: Theorem
### Triangle inequality  {#theorem-triangle-inequality}

For every $x, y \in \R$ we have
$$
| |x| - |y| | \leq |x+y| \leq |x| + |y| \,.
$$ {#eq-triangle-inequality}
:::


Before proceeding with the proof, let us discuss the geometric meaning of the triangle inequality.



::: Remark
### Geometric meaning of triangle inequality

The notion of absolute value can be extended also to vectors in the plane. Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are two vectors in the plane, as in @fig-triangle-ineq-1 below. Then $|x|$ and $|y|$ can be interpreted as the **lengths** of these vectors.  
Using the rule of sum of vectors, we can draw $x+y$, as shown in @fig-triangle-ineq-2 below. From the picture it is evident that 
$$
|x+y| \leq |x| + |y|\,,
$$ {#eq-triangle-inequality-1}
that is, *the length of each side of a triangle does not exceed the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides*. Note that (@eq-triangle-inequality-1) is exactly the second inequality in (@eq-triangle-inequality). This is why (@eq-triangle-inequality) is called triangle inequality.
:::


![Vectors $x$ and $y$](/images/triangle_ineq_1.png){#fig-triangle-ineq-1 width=20%}


![Summing the vectors $x$ and $y$. The triangle inequality relates the length of $x+y$ to the length of $x$ and $y$](/images/triangle_ineq_2.png){#fig-triangle-ineq-2 width=35%}





::: Proof
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-triangle-inequality}

Assume that $x,y \in \R$. We prove the two inequalities in (@eq-triangle-inequality) individually.

*Step 1. Proof of the second inequality in (@eq-triangle-inequality).*  
Trivially we have
$$
|x| \leq |x| \,.
$$
Therefore we can apply Lemma \ref{lemma-absolute-value} and infer
$$
-|x| \leq x \leq |x| \,.
$$ {#eq-triangle-inequality-3}
Similarly we have that $|y| \leq |y|$, and so Lemma \ref{lemma-absolute-value} implies
$$
-|y| \leq y \leq |y| \,.
$$ {#eq-triangle-inequality-4}
Summing (@eq-triangle-inequality-3) and (@eq-triangle-inequality-4) we get
$$
-(|x| + |y|) \leq x + y \leq |x| + |y| \,.
$$
We can now again apply Lemma \ref{lemma-absolute-value} to get
$$
|x + y| \leq |x| + |y| \,,
$$ {#eq-triangle-inequality-5}
which is the second inequality in (@eq-triangle-inequality).

*Step 2. Proof of the first inequality in (@eq-triangle-inequality).*  
Note that the trivial identity
$$
x = x+y - y
$$
always holds. We then have
\begin{align}
|x| & = |x+y - y| \\
    & = |(x+y) + (-y)| \\
    & = |a+b|
\end{align}
with $a=x+y$ and $b=-y$. We can now apply (@eq-triangle-inequality-5) to $a$ and $b$ to obtain
\begin{align}
|x| & = |a+b| \\
    & \leq |a| + |b| \\
    & = |x+y| + |-y| \\
    & = |x+y| + |y|
\end{align}
Therefore
$$
|x| - |y| \leq |x+y| \,.
$$ {#eq-triangle-inequality-6}
We can now swap $x$ and $y$ in (@eq-triangle-inequality-6) to get
$$
|y| - |x| \leq |x+y| \,.
$$
By rearranging the above inequality we obtain
$$
-|x+y| \leq |x| - |y|  \,.
$$ {#eq-triangle-inequality-7}
Putting together (@eq-triangle-inequality-6) and (@eq-triangle-inequality-7) yields
$$
-|x+y| \leq |x| - |y| \leq |x+y| \,.  
$$
By Lemma \ref{lemma-absolute-value} the above is equivalent to
$$
||x| - |y|| \leq |x+y| \,,
$$
which is the first inequality in (@eq-triangle-inequality).
:::



An immediate consequence of the triangle inequality are the following inequalities, which are left as an exercise. 



::: Remark
For any $x,y \in \R$ it holds
$$
||x|-|y|| \leq |x-y| \leq |x|+|y|\,.
$$
Moreover for any  $x,y,z \in \R$ it holds
$$
|x-y| \leq |x-z| + |z-y| \,.
$$
:::





## Proofs in Mathematics

In a mathematical proof one needs to show that 
$$
\alpha \implies \beta
$${#eq-implication}
where 

- $\alpha$ is a given set of assumptions, or **Hypothesis**
- $\beta$ is a conclusion, or **Thesis**

Proving (@eq-implication) means convincing ourselves that $\beta$ follows from $\alpha$. Common strategies to prove (@eq-implication) are:

1. **Contradiction**: Assume that the thesis is **false**, and hope to reach a contradiction: that is, prove that 
$$
\neg \beta \implies \, \mbox{ contradiction}
$$
where $\neg \beta$ is the **negation** of $\beta$. 

    >For example we already proved by contradiction that 
    $$
    \mbox{Definition of } \Q  \, \implies \, \sqrt{2} \notin \Q \,,
    $$
    In the above statement 
    $$
    \alpha = \left( \mbox{Definition of } \Q \right) \,.
    $$
    $$
    \beta = \left( \sqrt{2} \notin \Q \right) \,.
    $$
    Therefore
    $$
    \neg \beta  = \left(  \sqrt{2} \in \Q \right) \,.
    $$ 

2. **Direct**: Sometimes proofs will also need **direct** arguments, meaning that one need to show directly that (@eq-implication) holds.

3. **Contrapositive**: The statement (@eq-implication) is equivalent to
$$
\neg \beta \, \implies \, \neg \alpha \,.
$$ {#eq-contrapositive}
Thus, instead of proving (@eq-implication), one could show (@eq-contrapositive). The statement (@eq-contrapositive) is called the **contrapositive** of (@eq-implication).


Let us make an example.

::: { .Proposition  #proposition-easy}

Two real numbers $a,b$ are equal if and only if for every real number $\e >0$ it follows that $|a-b|<\e$.  
:::

Before proceeding with the proof, note that the above stetement is just saying that:

> Two numbers are equal if and only if they are **arbitrarily** close 

By *arbitrarily close* we mean that they are *as close as you want the to be*.


::: Proof
### of Proposition \ref{proposition-easy}

Let us first rephrase the statement using mathematical symbols:  

> Let $a, b \in \R$. Then it holds:
$$
a=b \, \iff \, |a-b| < \e \,, \,\, \forall \, \e>0 \,. 
$$ 

Setting
\begin{align}
\alpha & = \left(  a=b \right)   \\
\beta  & = \left( |a-b| < \e \,, \,\, \forall \, \e>0 \right)
\end{align}
the statement is equivalent to 
$$
\alpha \iff \beta \,.
$$
To show the above, it is sufficient to show that
$$
\alpha \implies \beta \quad \mbox{ and } \quad \beta \implies \alpha \,.
$$


*Step 1. Proof that $\alpha \implies \beta$*.  
This proof can be carried out by a **direct** argument. Since we are assuming $\alpha$, this means 
$$
a=b \,.
$$
We want to see that $\beta$ holds. Therefore fix an arbitrary $\e>0$. This means that $\e$ can be **any** positive number, as long as you fix it. Clearly
$$
|a-b| = |0| = 0 < \e
$$
since $a=b$, $|0|=0$, and $\e>0$. The above shows that 
$$
|a-b| < \e \,.
$$
As $\e>0$ was arbitrary, we have just proven that 
$$
|a-b| < \e \,, \,\, \forall \, \e >0 \,,
$$
meaning that $\beta$ holds and the proof is concluded.


*Step 2. Proof that $\beta \implies \alpha$*.   
Let us prove this implication by showing the **contrapositive**
$$
\neg \alpha \implies \neg\beta \,.
$$
So let us assume $\neg \alpha$ is true. This means that 
$$
a \neq b \,.
$$ 
We have to see that $\neg \beta$ holds. But $\neg \beta$ means that 
$$
\exists \, \e_0> 0 \st |a-b| \geq \e_0 \,. 
$$
The above is satisfied by choosing
$$
 \e_0 := |a-b| \,,
$$
since $\e_0 >0$ given that $a \neq b$.
:::







## Induction

Another technique for carrying out proofs is **induction**, which we take as an axiom.  

::: Axiom 
### Principle of Induction

Let $S \subseteq  \N$. Suppose that 

1. We have $1 \in S$, and
2. Whenever $n \in S$, then $(n+1) \in S$.

Then we have 
$$
S=\N \,.
$$
:::

::: Important
The above is an **axiom**, meaning that we do not prove it, but rather we just **assume it holds**.
:::

::: Remark
It would be possible to prove the Principle of Induction starting from elementary axioms for $\N$, called the **Peano Axioms**, see the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms#Peano_arithmetic_as_first-order_theory).  
However, in justifying basic principles of mathematics, one at some point needs to draw a line. This means that something which looks elementary needs to be assumed to hold, in order to have a starting point for proving deeper statements.  
In the case of the Principle of Induction, the intuition is clear:

> The Principle of Induction is just describing the **domino effect**: *If one tile falls, then the next one will fall as well*. Therefore if the *first tile falls, all the tiles will fall*.

It seems reasonable to assume such evident principle. 
:::

The Principle of Induction can be used to prove statements which depend on some index $n \in \N$. Precisely, the following statement holds.

::: Corollary
### Principle of Inducion - Alternative formulation

Let $\alpha(n)$ be a statement which depends on $n \in \N$. Suppose that 

1. $\alpha(1)$ is true, and
2. Whenever $\alpha(n)$ is true, then $\alpha(n+1)$ is true.

Then $\alpha(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
:::

::: Proof
Define the set 
$$
S:= \{ n \in \N \st \alpha(n) \mbox{ is true}   \} \,.
$$
Then 

1. We have $1 \in S$, since $\alpha(1)$ is true.
2. If $n \in S$ then $\alpha(n)$ is true. By assumption this implies that $\alpha(n+1)$ is true. Therefore $(n+1) \in S$.

Therefore $S$ satisfies the assumptions of the Induction Principle and we conclude that 
$$
S=\N \,.
$$
By definition this means that $\alpha(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
:::


::: Example 
### Formula for summing first $n$ natural numbers
Using the Principle of Induction we can prove that
$$
1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (n-1) + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} 
$$ {#eq-formula-sum-naturals}
holds for all $n \in \N$.  

*Proof*. To be really precise, consider the statement
$$
\alpha(n) :=  \, \mbox{the above formula is true for } \, n \,. 
$$
In order to apply induction, we need to show that 

1. $\alpha(1)$ is true,
2. If $\alpha(n)$ is true then $\alpha(n+1)$ is true.

Let us proceed:

1. It is immediate to check that (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for $n=1$.
2. Suppose (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for $n$. Then
\begin{align}
1 + \ldots +  n + (n+1) & =   \frac{n(n+1)}{2}  + (n+1) \\
& = \frac{ n(n+1) + 2(n+1) }{2} \\
& = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{n}
\end{align}
where in the first equality we used that (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for $n$. We then have
$$
1 +   \ldots + n + (n+1) = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{n}\,,
$$
which shows that (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for $n+1$.

By the Principle of Induction we then conclude that $\alpha(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$, which means that (@eq-formula-sum-naturals) holds for all $n \in \N$.

::: Example
### Statements about sequences of numbers

Suppose you are given a collection of numbers
$$
\{ x_n \st n \in \N\} \,.
$$
Such collection of numbers is called **sequence**. Assume that 
\begin{align}
& x_1  := 1 \\
& x_{n+1}  := \frac{x_n}{2} + 1 \,.
\end{align}
A sequence defined as above is called **recurrence sequence**. Using the above rule we can compute all the terms of $x_n$. 

>For example
\begin{align}
x_2 & = \frac{x_1}{2} + 1 = \frac12 + 1 =\frac{3}{2} \\
x_3 & = \frac{x_2}{2} + 1 =  \frac34 + 1 = \frac74 \,.
\end{align}

By computing these terms, we suspect that the sequence might be increasing, meaning that 
$$
x_{n+1} \geq x_n
$$ {#eq-induction-increasing}
for all $n \in \N$. 


*Claim. (@eq-induction-increasing) holds for all $n \in \N$*.

*Proof of Claim.*  
We argue by induction:

1. We have seen that $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 3/2$. Thus
$$
x_2 \geq x_1 \,.
$$
2. Suppose now that 
$$
x_{n+1} \geq x_{n} \,. 
$$ {#eq-induction-increasing-1}
We need to prove that
$$
x_{n+2} \geq x_{n+1} \,.
$${#eq-induction-increasing-2}
Indeed, we can multiply the inequality (@eq-induction-increasing-1) by $1/2$ and add $1$ to get
$$
\frac{x_{n+1}}{2} + 1 \geq \frac{x_{n}}{2} + 1   \,.
$$
The above is equivalent, by definition, to (@eq-induction-increasing-2).

Therefore the assumptions of the Induction Principle are satisfied, and (@eq-induction-increasing) follows.
