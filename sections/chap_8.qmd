# Series



A series is the sum of all terms in a sequence:
$$
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_n + \ldots 
$$
Since we are dealing with an infinite amount of terms, we need to be careful.
For example, consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n = -1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - \ldots 
$${#eq-series-introduction}
If we sum the terms in pairs, we obtain
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n = (-1 + 1) + (- 1 + 1) + ( - 1 + 1) + \ldots  = 0\,.
$$
If we reorder the terms, we obtain a different result
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^n & = (1 + 1) - 1 + (1 + 1) - 1 + \ldots  \\
                         & = (2 - 1) + (2 - 1) + \ldots \\
                         & = 1 + 1 + \ldots \\
                         & = \infty \,. 
\end{align*}
Therefore commutativity of the sum does not hold when summing infinitely many terms. We need a good definition of convergence.


## Convergent series

We will develop the theory of series for sequences in $\mathbb{C}$. All the results for complex series will also hold for series in $\mathbb{R}$. Some results will only hold for series in $\R$: this will be the case for comparison tests
in which the order relation of $\R$ is needed.


We start by defining partial sums.

::: Definition 
### Partial sums

Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{C}$. The $k$-th partial sum of $(a_n)$ is
$$
s_{k} :=a_{1}+a_{2}+\ldots+a_{k} = \sum_{n=1}^{k} a_{n}
$$
This sequence $\left(s_{k}\right)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is called the sequence of **partial sums**.

:::


We can use the sequence of partial sums to define convergence of a series.


::: Definition 
### Convergent series

Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{C}$. We denote the series of $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ by
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}
$$
We say that this series **converges** to $s \in \mathbb{C}$ if
$$
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=1}^{k} a_{n} = 
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} s_{k} = s \,.
$$
In this case we write
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n} = s \,.
$$

:::


::: Definition 
### Divergent series

Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{C}$. The series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n 
$$
is **divergent** if the sequence of partial sums $(s_k)$ is divergent.

:::


::: Example 
Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \,.
$$
Note that
$$
\frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1} \,.
$$
Hence, we can compute the partial sums $s_{n}$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
s_{k} & =\sum_{n=1}^{k} \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \\
& =\sum_{n=1}^{k}\left(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{1}-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\ldots+\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k+1} \\
& =1-\frac{1}{k+1} .
\end{align*}
Since,
$$
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} s_{k}=\lim _{k \rightarrow \infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{k+1}\right)=1 \,,
$$
the series converges to $1$, that is,
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)}=1 \,.
$$
A series of this kind is called a **telescopic sum**, since we can *fold* the entire partial sum together, in such a way that only two terms remain.
:::

Let us go back to the series considered in (@eq-series-introduction).

::: Example 

Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n} \,.
$$
The partial sums $s_{k}$ are given by
$$
s_{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{k}(-1)^{n}= 
\begin{cases}-1 & \text { if } \, n \, \text { is odd }  \, \\ 
0 & \text { if } \, n  \, \text { is even. }\end{cases}
$$
Therefore $s_{k}$ diverges, so also the series diverges.

:::


In general, it is a difficult taks to compute the exact value of a series. Therefore, we will mainly focus our effort on determining whether a series converges or not. 

The following theorem shows that if the terms in the sequence do not converge to $0$, then the series cannot converge.

::: Theorem 
### Necessary Condition for Convergence {#theorem-series-necessary}

Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{C}$. If the series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n} 
$$ 
converges, then 
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=0 \,.
$$

:::

::: Proof

Suppose that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}
$$ 
converges. By definition of convergent series there exists some $s \in \mathbb{C}$ such that
$$
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} s_{k}=\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=1}^{k} a_{n} = s \,.
$$
Then also
$$
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} s_{k+1} = s \,.
$$
Hence, by the Algebra of Limits in $\C$, we have that
$$
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\left(s_{k+1}-s_{k}\right)=\lim _{k \rightarrow \infty} s_{k+1}-\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} s_{k} = s - s = 0 \,.
$$
Noting that 
$$
s_{k+1} - s_{k} = a_{k+1}\,, \quad \forall \, k \in \N \,,
$$ 
we obtain
$$
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} a_{k}
= \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} a_{k+1}
= \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \left( s_{k+1} - s_{k} \right) = 0 \, .
$$

:::



::: Important 

Theorem \ref{theorem-series-necessary} is saying that, if 
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} \neq 0 \,,
$$
then the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}
$$ 
does not converge.

:::




::: Example 

Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty  (-1)^n \,.
$${#eq-example-series-1}
We have that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} (-1)^n  \neq 0 \,,
$$
being $(a_n)$ divergent. Therefore the series at (@eq-example-series-1) diverges
by Theorem \ref{theorem-series-necessary}.

:::


::: Example 

Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{5 n+11} \,.
$$
Then
$$
a_{n}:=\frac{n}{5 n+11}=\frac{1}{5 + \dfrac{11}{n} } \longrightarrow \frac{1}{5} \neq 0 \,.
$$
Hence, the series does not converge.

:::
 

::: Important

Theorem \ref{theorem-series-necessary} says that if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges, 
then
$$
a_n \to 0 \,.
$$
The converse is false: In general the condition $a_n \to 0$ does not guarantee convergence of the 
associated series, as shown in the example below.

:::


::: Example

Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \,, \quad a_n := \frac{1}{ \sqrt{n+1} + \sqrt{n} } \,.
$$
By the Algebra of Limits we have
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0 \,.
$$
However the partial sums are given by
$$
s_k = \sum_{n=1}^k a_n = \sqrt{k+1} - 1 \,.
$$
Therefore $(s_k)$ is divergent and so the series is divergent.

> Exercise: Prove by induction that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^k a_n = \sqrt{k+1} - 1 \,.
$$

:::



::: Remark

It is customary to sum a series starting at $n=1$. However one could start
the sum at any $n=N$ with $N \in \N$. This does not affect the convergence
of the series, in the sense that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \,\, \mbox{ converges \,} \iff \,\,
\sum_{n=N}^\infty a_n \,\, \mbox{ converges.} 
$$
In case of convergence, we would of course have
$$
\sum_{n=N}^\infty a_n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n - \left(  a_1 + \ldots + a_{N-1} \right) \,.
$$

:::


::: Example 

We have seen that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)} = 1 \,.
$$
Hence also the series
$$
\sum_{n=7}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)}
$$
converges. However, in this case, the partial sums are given by
\begin{align*}
s_{k} & =\sum_{n=7}^{k} \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \\
      & =\sum_{n=7}^{k}\left(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\right) \\
      & =\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}-\frac{1}{9}+\ldots+\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k+1} \\
      & =\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{k+1} \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore
$$
\sum_{n=7}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} s_{k} = \frac{1}{7} \,.
$$

## Geometric series


::: Definition
### Geometric Series in $\C$

Let $x \in \C$. The **geometric series** of ratio $x$ is the series
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{n} \,.
$$

:::


Geometric series are one of the few types of series that can be explicitly computed, as stated 
in the following theorem.


::: Theorem 
### Geometric Series Test  {#theorem-geometric-series-test}

Let $x \in \C$. We have: 

1. If $|x|<1$, then the geometric series of ratio $x$ converges, with

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{n}=\frac{1}{1-x} \,.
$${#eq-geometric-series-sum}

2. If $|x| \geq 1$, then the geometric series of ratio $x$ diverges.

:::


::: Important

Recall that the Geometric Sequence Test does not cover the case $|x|=1$, since in general the sequence
$$
a_n = x^n
$$
could be convergent or divergent. However the Geometric Series
Test covers the case $|x|=1$, in which case
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{n}
$$
diverges.

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1*. Suppose that $|x|<1$. By using induction we prove that
$$
s_{k} := \sum_{n=0}^{k} x^{n}=\frac{1-x^{k+1}}{1-x} \,, \quad \forall \, k \in \N \,.
$${#eq-proof-geometric-series}

- Base case: For $k=0$, we get that
$$
s_{0} = x^{0} = 1 = \frac{1-x^{1}}{1-x} \,.
$$

- Induction step: Let $k \in \N \cup \{0\}$ and suppose that 
$$
s_{k}=\frac{1-x^{k+1}}{1-x} \,.
$$
Then,
\begin{align*}
s_{k+1} & = s_{k}+x^{k+1} \\
        & = \frac{1-x^{k+1}}{1-x}+x^{k+1} \\
        & = \frac{1-x^{k+1}+(1-x) x^{k+1}}{1-x} \\
        & = \frac{1-x^{k+1}+x^{k+1}-x^{k+2}}{1-x} \\
        & = \frac{1-x^{k+2}}{1-x} \,,
\end{align*}
concluding the proof of the inductive step.


By the Principle of Induction formula (@eq-proof-geometric-series) holds for all $k \in \N$.
Since $|x|<1$, by the Geometric Sequence Test we infer 
$$
\lim_{k \to \infty} \, x^{k} = 0 \,.
$$ 
Hence
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{n} & = \lim_{k \to \infty } \, s_k \\
                          & = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}  \, \frac{1-x^{k+1}}{1-x} \\
                          & = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1-x \cdot x^{k}}{1-x} \\
                          & = \frac{1}{1-x} \,,
\end{align*}
where the last equality follows from the Algebra of Limits.


*Part 2.* Suppose $|x| \geq 1$. Then
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, x^n \neq 0 \,.
$${#eq-proof-geometric-series-2}
Indeed, suppose by contradiction that $x_n \to 0$. Hence, for $\e = 1/2$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\left|x^{n}-0\right| < \e = \frac{1}{2}  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq \N \,.
$$
However 
$$
\left|x^{n}-0\right| = |x^n| = |x|^n \geq 1 \,,
$$
which yields
$$
1 < \e = \frac12 \,, 
$$
contradiction. Then (@eq-proof-geometric-series-2) holds and the series 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{n}
$$ 
diverges by the Necessary Condition in Theorem \ref{theorem-series-necessary}.


:::



Let us show some applications of the Geometric Series Test of Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-series-test}.


::: Example 

- Since $\left|\frac{1}{2}\right|<1$ we have
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}=\frac{1}{1-\dfrac{1}{2}}=2
$$

- Since $\left|\frac{-3}{2}\right|=\frac{3}{2}>1$
the series 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)^{n}
$$ 
does not converge.

- Since $\left|\frac{-3}{4}\right|=\frac{3}{4}<1$, we have
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{-3}{4}\right)^{n}=\frac{1}{1-\dfrac{-3}{4}}=\frac{1}{\dfrac{7}{4}}=\frac{4}{7}
$$

-  Since $|-1|=1$, the series 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}
$$ 
does not converge.


:::


::: Remark

If the sum of a Geometric Sries does not start at $n=0$, we need to tweak the summation formula 
at (@eq-geometric-series-sum). For example, if $|x|<1$, and we start the series at $n=1$, we get
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty x^k = \frac{1}{1-x} - 1 = \frac{x}{1-x} \,.
$$

:::


::: Example 

We have that

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}=   
\frac{ \dfrac{1}{2}}{1- \dfrac{1}{2}} = 1 \,.
$$

:::


The Geometric Series Test of Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-series-test} can be applied to complex geometric series as well.


::: Example 

- Consider the series 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1+i)^{n}} \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\frac{1}{(1+i)^{n}}=\left(\frac{1}{1+i}\right)^{n}
$$
and 
$$
\left|\frac{1}{1+i}\right| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} < 1\,,
$$
Therefore the series converges by the Geometric Series Test, and
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1+i)^{n}} & = \frac{1}{1-\dfrac{1}{1+i}} \\
                                        & = \frac{1}{\dfrac{1+i-1}{1+i}} \\
                                        & = \frac{1+i}{i} \\
                                        & = \frac{(1+i) i}{i^{2}} \\
                                        & = \frac{i-1}{-1} \\
                                        & = 1-i \,.
\end{align*}



- Consider the series 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{-5-5 i}{3+3 i}\right)^{n} \,.
$$
Since
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{-5-5 i}{3+3 i}\right| & = \frac{|-5-5 i|}{|3+3 i|}  \\
                                  & =\frac{\sqrt{(-5)^{2}+(-5)^{2}}}{\sqrt{3^{2}+3^{2}}} \\
                                  & = \sqrt{\frac{50}{18}} \\
                                  & =\frac{5}{3} > 1 \,,
\end{align*}
the above series does not converge.

- Consider the series 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{2+i}{3-2 i}\right)^{n} \,.
$$
We have
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{2+i}{3-2 i}\right| & = \frac{|2+i|}{|3-2 i|} \\
                               & = \frac{\sqrt{2^{2}+1^{2}}}{\sqrt{3^{2}+(-2)^{2}}} \\
                               & = \sqrt{\frac{5}{13}} < 1 \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore the series converges by the Geometric Series Test, and
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{2+i}{3-2 i}\right)^{n} & = \frac{1}{1-\dfrac{2+i}{3-2 i}} \\
& = \frac{1}{\dfrac{3-2 i-(2+i)}{3-2 i}} \\
& = \frac{3-2 i}{1-3 i} \\
& = \frac{3-2 i}{1-3 i} \, \frac{1+3 i}{1+3 i} \\
& = \frac{3-2 i+9 i-6 i^{2}}{1-9 i^{2}} \\
& = \frac{9+7 i}{10} \\
& = \frac{9}{10} + \frac{7}{10} i
\end{align*}

## Algebra of Limits for Series

We have proven the Algebra of Limit Theorem for sequences in $\C$. A similar results holds
for series as well.

::: Theorem 
### Algebra of Limits for Series   {#theorem-algebra-limits-series}


Let $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\left(b_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be sequences in $\mathbb{C}$ and let $c \in \mathbb{C}$. Suppose that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}=a \,, \qquad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}=b \,.
$$
Then:

1. The sum of series is the series of the sums:
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n} \pm b_{n}\right) = a \pm b \,.
$$

2. The product of a series with a number obeys
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c \cdot a_{n}= c \cdot a \,.
$$


:::



::: Proof


*Part 1.* We prove the formula with the $+$ sign, since in the other case the proof is the same. To this end, define the partial sums
$$
s_{k} := \sum_{n=1}^{k} a_{n} \,, \quad t_{k} := \sum_{n=1}^{k} b_{n} \,, \quad v_{k} := \sum_{n=1}^{k}\left(a_{n}+b_{n}\right) \,.
$$
We can write
\begin{align*}
v_k   & = \sum_{n=1}^{k} \left(a_{n}+b_{n}\right) \\
      & = \left(a_{1}+b_{1}\right)+\ldots+\left(a_{k}+b_{k}\right) \\
      & = \left(a_{1}+\ldots+a_{k}\right)+\left(b_{1}+\ldots+b_{k}\right) \\
      & = s_{k} + t_{k} \,.
\end{align*}
By assumption $s_{k} \to a$ and $t_{k} \to b$. Hence, by the Algebra of Limits in $\C$, we infer
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}+b_{n}\right) &  = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} v_{k} \\
      & = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \left(s_{k}+t_{k}\right) \\
      & = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \, s_{k} + \lim_{k \to \infty} \, t_{k}  \\
      & = a + b \,.
\end{align*}


*Part 2.* Denote the partial sums by
$$
s_{k} := \sum_{n=1}^{k} a_{n} \, , \quad  t_{k} := \sum_{n=1}^{k} c \cdot a_{n} \,.
$$
We can write
\begin{align*}
t_k & = \sum_{n=1}^{k} c \cdot a_{k} \\
    & = c \cdot a_{1} +c \cdot a_{2}+\ldots+c \cdot a_{k} \\
    & = c \cdot \left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\ldots+a_{k}\right) = \\
    & = c \cdot s_{k} \,.
\end{align*}
By assumption $s_{k} \to a$, so that the Algebra of Limits in $\C$ allows to conclude
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c \cdot a_{n} & = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} t_{k} \\
                                  & = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} c \cdot s_{k} \\
                                  & = c \cdot a \,.
\end{align*}

:::


Let us apply the Algebra of Limits for Series to a concrete example. 

::: Example 

Consider the following series

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n}+\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n}\right) \,.
$$
Note that
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n}=\frac{1}{1-\dfrac{1}{3}}=\frac{3}{2} \,, \quad 
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n}=\frac{1}{1-\dfrac{2}{3}}=3 \,,
$$
by the Geometric Series Test of Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-series-test}.
Therefore we can apply the Algebra of Limit for Series to conclude
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n}+\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n}\right) & 
=
2 \cdot \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{k} 
+ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{k} \\ 
& = 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} + 3 = 6
\end{align*}

:::


::: Important

The Algebra of Limits Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits-series} does not discuss product and quotient of series. The situation becomes more complicated in this case: Indeed, we have
$$
(a_1 + a_2) \cdot (a_2 + b_2) = a_1b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1  \,.
$$
Therefore, in general, we can expect
$$
 \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \right) \cdot \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n \right) \neq 
 \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \cdot b_n \,.
$${#eq-product-series}
A way to compute
$$
\left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \right) \cdot \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n \right)
$$
is through the so-called **Cauchy Product** of two series. We do not cover the latter, and the interested reader 
can refer to Page $82$ in [@abbott]. 

Similarly, we expect that
$$
 \dfrac{ \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n }{ \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n } 
 \neq \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} \,.
$${#eq-quotient-series}

:::


Let us give two examples to show that formulas (@eq-product-series) and (@eq-quotient-series) hold.


::: Example 

- We know that
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}=\frac{1}{1-\dfrac{1}{2}}=2 \,.
$${#eq-product-series-2}
Therefore
$$
\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n} \right) \cdot 
\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n} \right)  
= 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \,. 
$$
However
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n} \cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}
= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n} 
= \frac{1}{1-\dfrac{1}{4}} 
= \frac{4}{3}  \,.
$$
Hence 
$$
\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n} \right) \cdot 
\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n} \right)  = 4 \neq \frac{4}{3} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n} \cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n} \,.

\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}}{\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \,.

## Non-negative series


We now investigate series of which all terms are non-negative. To be precise:

::: Definition 
### Non-negative series

Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. We call the series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}
$$ 
a **non-negative series** if
$$
a_n \geq 0 \,, \quad  \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$

:::


The key remark for non-negative series is that the partial sums are increasing.


:::{.Lemma #lemma-partial-sums-increasing}

Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ with 
$$
a_n \geq 0 \,, \quad  \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Define the partial sums as
$$
s_k := \sum_{n=1}^k a_n \,.
$$
The sequence $(s_k)$ is increasing.

:::


::: Proof

For all $k \in \N$ we have
$$
s_{k+1} = \sum_{n=1}^{k+1} a_n = s_k + a_{k+1} \geq s_k \,,
$$
where we used that $a_{k+1} \geq 0$. Therefore $(s_k)$ is increasing.

:::



Therefore, if we have a series with non-negative terms
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
$$
there are only $2$ options:

- $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges,
- $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ diverges to $+\infty$.

This is because the partial sums $(s_k)$ are increasing. Therefore we have either:

- $(s_k)$ is bounded above: Then $s_k$ converges by the Monotone Convergence Theorem
- $(s_k)$ is not bounded above: Therefore $s_k$ diverges to $+\infty$.


We present several tests for the convergence of non-negative series. 


### Cauchy Condensation Test


Let us start with the study of the two non-negative series:
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} \,, \quad 
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$

::: Question 

Do the above series converge or diverge?

:::


The answer is that the first series converges, while the second diverges.
We prove it in the next two theorems.



::: Theorem 

The following series converges
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} \,.
$$


:::


::: Proof

For $k \in \N$ define the sequence of partial sums 
$$
s_{k} := \sum_{n=1}^k \frac{1}{n^2} \,.
$$
Note that 
\begin{align*}
s_k & = 1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{k^2} \\
    & = 1 + \frac{1}{2 \cdot 2} + \frac{1}{3 \cdot 3} + \frac{1}{4 \cdot 4} + \ldots + \frac{1}{k \cdot k} \\
    & < 1 + \frac{1}{2 \cdot 1} + \frac{1}{3 \cdot 2} + \frac{1}{4 \cdot 3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{k \cdot (k-1)} \\
    & = 1 + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}  \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4}  \right) + \ldots + \left( \frac{1}{k-1} - \frac{1}{k}  \right) \\
    & = 1 + 1 - \frac{1}{k} \\
    & = 2 - \frac{1}{k} \\
    & < 2 \,,
\end{align*}
showing that $s_k$ is bounded above. Recall that $s_k$ is increasing, by 
Lemma \ref{lemma-partial-sums-increasing}. Therefore, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem,
we conclude that $s_k$ converges. Hence the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}
$$
is convergent.

::: Theorem 
### Harmonic series  {#theorem-harmonic-series}

The **harmonic series**
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}
$$
is divergent.

:::



::: Proof

For $k \in \N$ define the sequence of partial sums 
$$
s_{k} := \sum_{n=1}^k \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$
Note that 
$$
s_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}
$$
while
\begin{align*}
s_4 & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \right) \\
    & > 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \right) \\
    & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 2 \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \\
    & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \\
    & = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \\
\end{align*}
Similarly
\begin{align*}
s_4 & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \right) + 
        \left( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{8} \right) \\
    & > 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \right) + 
        \left( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} \right) \\
    & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 2 \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) + 4 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) \\
    & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \\
    & = 1 + 3 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \\
\end{align*}
Proceeding in a similar way, for $k \in \N$ we have 
\begin{align*}
s_{2^k} & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \right) + 
        \left( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{8} \right) \\
        & \qquad + \ldots + \left( \frac{1}{2^{k-1} + 1} + \ldots + \frac{1}{2^k} \right) \\
    & > 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \right) + 
        \left( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} \right) \\
        & \qquad + \ldots + \left( \frac{1}{2^k} + \ldots + \frac{1}{2^k} \right) \\
    & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 2 \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) + 4 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) + \ldots +
            2^{k-1} \left( \frac{1}{2^k} \right)\\
    & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{2} \\
    & = 1 + k \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \\
\end{align*}
Hence
$$
s_{2^k} > 1 + k \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \,, \quad \forall \, k \in \N \,,
$$
showing that $s_{2^k}$ is unbounded. Therefore $s_k$ is unbounded, and $s_k$ does not converge. Therefore the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1n
$$
is divergent.

:::



The proofs of the above theorems inspire the Cauchy Condensation Test.



::: Theorem
### Cauchy Condensation Test  {#theorem-cauchy-test}

Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence in $\R$. Suppose that $(a_n)$ is non-negative and decreasing, that is,
$$
a_{n} \geq a_{n+1} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,. 
$$
They are equivalent:

1. The series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
$$ 
converges.

2. The series
$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^n a_{2^n} = a_1 + 2a_2 + 8a_8 + 16 a_{16} + \ldots 
$$
converges. 

:::


::: Proof

For $k \in \N$ denote the partial sums by 
$$
s_k := \sum_{n=1}^k a_n \,, \quad t_k := \sum_{n=0}^k 2^n a_{2^n} \,.
$$
Since $a_n \geq 0$, it is immediate to check that the sequences $(s_k)$ and $(t_k)$ are increasing. 


*Part 1.* Assume that the series
$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^n a_{2^n}
$$
diverges. Hence the sequence $(t_k)$ diverges and therefore $(t_k)$ is not bounded above.

> Indeed, suppose $(t_k)$ was bounded above. Since $(t_k)$ is increasing,
we would conclude that $(t_k)$ is convergent by the Monotone Convergence Theorem. Contradiction.

We want to estimate $s_k$ from below. To this end, we notice that
\begin{align*}
s_2 & = a_1 + a_2  \\
    & \geq \frac{1}{2} a_1 + a_2 \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \left(  a_1 + 2a_2  \right) \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \, t_1 \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $a_n \geq 0$, and so $a_1 > a_1/2$. Moreover
\begin{align*}
s_4 & = a_1 + a_2 + (a_3 + a_4) \\
    & \geq a_1 + a_2 + (a_4 + a_4) \\
    & = a_1 + a_2 + 2a_4 \\
    & \geq \frac{1}{2} \, a_1 + a_2 + 2 a_4 \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \left(  a_1 + 2a_2 + 4a_4 \right) \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \, t_2 \,,
\end{align*}
where we used also that $(a_n)$ is decreasing. Similar reasoning yields
\begin{align*}
s_8 & = a_1 + a_2 + (a_3 + a_4) + (a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8) \\
    & \geq a_1 + a_2 + (a_4 + a_4) + (a_8 + a_8 + a_8 + a_8) \\
    & = a_1 + a_2 + 2 a_4 + 4 a_8 \\
    & \geq \frac{1}{2} \, a_1 + a_2 + 2 a_4 + 4 a_8 \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \left(  a_1 + 2a_2 + 4a_4 + 8 a_8 \right) \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \, t_3 \,.
\end{align*}
where again we used that $(a_n)$ is decreasing, and $a_n \geq 0$. Iterating, we obtain that for all $k \in \N$ it holds:
\begin{align*}
s_{2^k} & = a_1 + a_2 + (a_3 + a_4) + (a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8) \\
        & \qquad + \ldots + (a_{2^{k-1}} + \ldots + a_{2^k}) \\
    & \geq a_1 + a_2 + (a_4 + a_4) + (a_8 + a_8 + a_8 + a_8) \\
    & \qquad + \ldots + (a_{2^k} + \ldots + a_{2^k}) \\
    & = a_1 + a_2 + 2 a_4 + 4 a_8 + \ldots + 2^{k-1} a_{2^k}\\
    & \geq \frac{1}{2} \, a_1 + a_2 + 2 a_4 + 4 a_8 + \ldots + 2^{k-1} a_{2^k} \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \left(  a_1 + 2a_2 + 4a_4 + 8 a_8 + \ldots + 2^k a_{2^k} \right) \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \, t_k \,.
\end{align*}
We have shown that 
$$
s_{2^k} \geq \frac{1}{2} \, t_k \,, \quad  \forall \, k \in \N \,.
$$
Since $(t_k)$ is not bounded above, we infer that $(s_{2^k})$ is not
bounded above. In particular $(s_k)$ is not bounded, and hence divergent. Thus the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
$$
diverges.


*Part2.* Suppose that the series
$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^n a_{2^n}
$$
converges. Hence the sequence $(t_k)$ converges, and therefore $(t_k)$ is bounded. This means that there exists $M > 0$ such that 
$$
|t_k| \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Since $t_k \geq 0$, the above reads
$$
t_k \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Fix $k \in \N$ and let $m \in \N$ be such that
$$
k \leq 2^{m+1} - 1 \,.
$$
In this way 
$$
s_k \leq s_{2^{m+1}-1} \,.
$$
We have
\begin{align*}
s_{2^{m+1}-1} & = a_1 + (a_2 + a_3) + (a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7) \\
              & \qquad + \ldots + (a_{2^m} + \ldots + a_{2^{m+1}-1}) \\
              & \leq a_1 + (a_2 + a_2) + (a_4 + a_4 + a_4 + a_4) \\
              & \qquad + \ldots + (a_{2^m} + \ldots + a_{2^m} ) \\
              & = a_1 + 2a_2 + 4a_4 + \ldots + 2^m a_{2^m} \\
              & = t_m \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $(a_n)$ is decreasing. We have then shown
$$
s_k \leq s_{2^{m+1}-1} \leq t_m \leq M \,.
$$
Since $M$ does not depend on $k$, we conclude that 
$$
s_k \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, k \in \N \,.
$$
As $s_k \geq 0$, we conclude that $s_k$ is bounded. Recalling that $(s_k)$ is increasing, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem we infer that $(s_k)$ converges. This proves that the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
$$
is convergent, ending the proof.

Thanks to the Cauchy Condensation Test of Theorem \ref{theorem-cauchy-test} we can prove
the following result.


::: Theorem 
### Convergence of $p$-series  {#theorem-p-series}

Let $p \in \mathbb{R}$. Consider the $p$-series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{p}} \,.
$$ 
We have:

1. If $p>1$ the $p$-series converges.

2. If $p \leq 1$ the $p$-series diverges.



:::


::: Proof

The series in question is
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n  \,, \quad  a_n := \frac{1}{n^p} \,.
$$
Note that $(a_n)$ is decreasing and non-negative. Hence, by the Cauchy Condensation Test of Theorem \ref{theorem-cauchy-test}, the $p$-series 
converges if and only if 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^n a_{2^n} 
$$
converges. We have
$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^n a_{2^n}  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^{n-np} = 
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (2^{1-p})^{n} \,,
$$
and the latter is a Geometric Series of ratio
$$
x := 2^{1-p} \,.
$$
By the Geometric Series Test, we have convergence of 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (2^{1-p})^{n} 
$$
if and only if 
$$
|x| < 1 \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to
$$
2^{1-p} < 1 = 2^0 \quad \iff \quad
1 - p < 0 \quad \iff \quad p > 1 \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p}
$$
converges if and only if $p>1$, ending the proof.

The following is another notable application of the Cauchy Condensation Test.


::: {.Theorem  #theorem-p-log-series}

Let $p \in \R$. Consider the series 
$$
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n \left( \log n \right)^p} \,.
$$ 
We have:

1. If $p>1$ the series converges.

2. If $p \leq 1$ the series diverges.

:::


::: Proof

The series in question is
$$
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} a_n \,, \quad a_n := \frac{1}{n \left( \log n \right)^p}  \,.
$$
Note that $(a_n)$ is non-negative and decreasing. Therefore we can apply
the Cauchy Condensation Test to conclude that the above series is convergent
if and only if the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^n a_{2^n} 
$$
is convergent. We have
$$
2^n a_{2^n} = 2^n \, \frac{1}{2^n  \left(  \log 2^n \right)^p } = \frac{1}{n^p \, \log 2} 
$$
so that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^n a_{2^n}  = \frac{1}{\log 2 } \, \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p} \,.
$$
The latter is a $p$-series, which by Theorem \ref{theorem-p-series} converges if and only if $p > 1$. Hence 
$$
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n \left( \log n \right)^p} 
$$ 
converges if and only if $p > 1$, and the proof is concluded.

### Comparison Test


Another really useful result to study the convergence of non-negative
series is the Comparison Test.


::: Theorem 
### Comparison test  {#theorem-comparison-test}

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\left(b_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be non-negative sequences. Suppose that there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
a_{n} \leq b_{n} \,, \quad \, \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
They hold:

1. If $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}$ converges, then also $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ converges.

2. If $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ diverges, then also $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}$ diverges.


:::


::: Proof

*Part 1*. Define the partial sums starting at $n=N$
$$
s_k := \sum_{n=N}^k a_k \,, \quad 
t_k := \sum_{n=N}^k b_k \,.
$$
Suppose that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}
$$
converges. Hence also the series
$$
\sum_{n=N}^{\infty} b_{n}
$$
converges. Then $(t_k)$ is a convergent sequence, which implies that $(t_k)$ is bounded, and hence bounded above. We have that $s_k$ is bounded above: Indeed, using the assumption, we have
\begin{align*}
s_k & = a_N + a_{N+1} + \ldots + a_k \\
    & \leq b_N + b_{N+1} + \ldots + b_k \\
    & = t_k \,,
\end{align*}
which reads
$$
s_k \leq t_k \,, \quad  \forall \, k \geq N \,.
$$
Therefore $(s_k)$ is bounded above, being $(t_k)$ bounded above. Recall
that $s_k$ is increasing, by Lemma \ref{lemma-partial-sums-increasing}. 
By the Monotone Convergence Theorem we conclude that $s_k$ is convergent, showing
that the series
$$
\sum_{n=N}^\infty a_n 
$$
converges. Hence also the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n 
$$
converges, concluding the proof of Point 1.

*Part 2.* Note that Point 2 is the contrapositive of Point 1, and hence it holds.

:::


Let us give two applications of the Comparison Test.


::: Example 

- Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{2}+3 n-1} \,.
$${#eq-comparison-example-1}
Since $3 n-1 \geq 0$ for all $n \in \N$, we get
$$
\frac{1}{n^{2}+3 n-1} \leq \frac{1}{n^{2}} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-p-series} the $p$-series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{2}}
$$ 
converges. Therefore also the series at (@eq-comparison-example-1) converges by the Comparison Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-comparison-test}.


- Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{3^{n}+6 n+\dfrac{1}{n+1}}{2^{n}} \,.
$${#eq-comparison-example-2}
Note that
$$
\frac{3^{n}+6 n+\dfrac{1}{n+1}}{2^{n}} \geq \frac{3^{n}}{2^{n}}=\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{n} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Since $\left|\frac{3}{2}\right|=\frac{3}{2}>1$, the series 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{n}
$$ 
diverges by the Geometric Series Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-geometric-series-test}. Therefore, by the Comparison Test, also the series
at (@eq-comparison-example-2) diverges.

### Limit Comparison Test


To apply the Comparison Test to the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \,, 
$$
one needs to find another sequence $(b_n)$ such that 
$$
a_n \leq b_n \,,\quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
or 
$$
b_n \leq a_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
This is not always possible. However, one might be able to show that 
$$
L = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n}
$$
for some $L \in \R$. In this case, the series of $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ can still be compared, 
in the sense specified in the below theorem.



::: Theorem 
### Limit Comparison Test  {#theorem-limit-comparison-test}

Let $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ be sequences such that
$$
a_n \geq 0 \,, \quad b_n > 0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in  \N \,.
$$
Suppose there exists $L \in \R$ such that
$$
L = \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}} \,.
$$
They hold:

1. If $0<L<\infty$, then
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n} \,\, \text { converges } \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n} \,\, \text { converges. }
$$

2. If $L=0$, then

      - If $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}$ converges also $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ converges,

      - If $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ diverges also $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}$ diverges.

::: 



::: Proof 

*Part 1.* Suppose that $0<L<1$. Set
$$
\e := \frac{L}{2} \,.
$$
Since $\e>0$ and $a_n/b_n \to L$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\left|\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}} - L \right| < \e   \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to 
$$
L - \e < \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}  < \e + L  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $\e = L/2$, we get
$$
\frac{L}{2}  < \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}  < \frac{3L}{2}  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
or equivalently,
$$
\frac{L}{2} \, b_n < a_n  < \frac{3L}{2} \, b_n  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
We are now ready to prove the main claim:

- Suppose that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}
$$ 
converges. Then also 
$$
\sum_{n=N}^{\infty} a_{n} \,,
$$ 
since we are only discarding a finite number of terms. As 
$$
\frac{L}{2} b_{n} \leq a_{n} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$ 
it follows from the Comparison Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-comparison-test} that the series
$$
\sum_{n=N}^{\infty} \frac{L}{2} b_{n} \,.
$$ 
converges. Since $L/2$ is a constant, we also conclude that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n} 
$$
converges.

- Suppose that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}
$$ 
converges. Then also 
$$
\sum_{n=N}^{\infty} \frac{3 L}{2} b_{n}
$$ 
converges. Since 
$$
a_{n} < \frac{3 L}{2} b_{n} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$ 
by the Comparison Test we infer that 
$$
\sum_{n=N}^{\infty} a_{n}
$$ 
converges. Therefore, also 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}

converges.

*Part 2.* Suppose that $L = 0$. Note that the second bullet point is the contrapositive of the first. Hence we only need to show the first bullet point. Let $\e = 1$. Since $a_n / b_n \to 0$, 
there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
\left|\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}-0\right| < \e = 1 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,. 
$$ 
Therefore
$$
a_{n} < b_{n} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
The thesis follows immediately by the Comparison Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-comparison-test}.

::: Important

It might happen that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty } \, \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}} = \infty \,.
$$
In this case it can be helpful to interchange the roles of $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$, since then 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty } \, \frac{b_{n}}{a_{n}} = 0 \,.
$$

Let us give a few applications of the Limit Comparison Tets.


::: Example 

The following series converges
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2 n^{3}+5 n+1}{7 n^{6}+2 n+5} \,.
$$

> *Proof*. Set
$$
a_n :=  \frac{2 n^{3}+5 n+1}{7 n^{6}+2 n+5}\,, \quad 
b_n := \frac{1}{n^3} \,.
$$
We have
\begin{align*}
L & :=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}  \frac{a_n}{b_n} \\
& = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2 n^{3}+5 n+1}{7 n^{6}+2 n+5} \bigg/  \frac{1}{n^{3}} \\
& = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2 n^{6}+5 n^{4}+n^{3}}{7 n^{6}+2 n+5} \\
& = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2+ \dfrac{5}{n^{2}} + \dfrac{1}{n^{3}} }{7 + \dfrac{2}{n^{5}}+ \dfrac{5}{n^{6}} } 
 = \frac{2}{7} \,.
\end{align*}
The series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{3}}
$$ 
converges, being a $p$-series with $p =3 > 1$. Since $L = \frac{2}{7}>0$, also the series of interest converges, by the Limit Comparison Test.

:::



::: Example 

Prove that the following series diverges 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n+\cos (n)}{n^{2}} \,.
$$

> *Proof.* We expect the terms in the series to behave like $1/n$ for large $n$. Hence we set
$$
a_n := \frac{n+\cos (n)}{n^{2}} \,, \quad b_n = \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$
We compute
\begin{align*}
L & := \frac{a_n}{b_n} \\ 
  & = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n+\cos (n)}{n^{2}} \bigg/ \frac{1}{n} \\
  &  = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^{2}+n \cos (n)}{n^{2}} \\
  & = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac{\cos (n)}{n}\right)
\end{align*}
Since
$$
-1 \leq \cos (n) \leq 1 \,,
$$
we obtain
$$
-\frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{\cos (n)}{n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$
As both $-\frac{1}{n} \rightarrow 0$ and $\frac{1}{n} \rightarrow 0$, by the Squeeze Theorem 
$$
\frac{\cos (n)}{n} \longrightarrow 0 \,.
$$
Hence 
$$
L = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac{\cos (n)}{n}\right) = 1 \,.
$$
The harmonic series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}
$$ 
does not converge. Since $L = 1 > 0$, the series of interest diverges by the Limit Comparison Test.

::: Example

Prove that the series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( 1 - \cos\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)

converges.

>*Solution.* Since 
$$
\cos \left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \leq 1 \,,
$$
the above is a non-negative series. Recall the limit
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1 - \cos(a_n)}{(a_n)^2} = \frac{1}{2} \,,
$$
where $(a_n)$ is a sequence in $\R$ such that $a_n \to 0$ and 
$$
a_n \neq 0 \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
In particular, for $a_n = 1/n$, we obtain
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, n^2 \, \left(1 - \cos \left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)  = \frac{1}{2} \,.
$$
Set
$$
b_n : =  1 - \cos\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)  \,, \quad
c_n := \frac{1}{n^2} \,.

We have
\begin{align*}
L & := \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{b_n}{c_n} \\
  & = \lim_{n \to \infty} n^2 \, \left(1 - \cos \left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right) \\
  & =  \frac{1}{2} \,.
\end{align*}
Note that the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} 
$$
converges, being a $p$-series with $p>2$. Therefore, since $L = 1/2 >0$, also the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( 1 - \cos\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)
$$
converges, by the Limit Comparison Test.

Sometimes the Limit Comparison Test fails, but the Comparison Test works.


::: Example 

Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1+\sin (n)}{n^{2}} \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\sin (n) \geq-1 \,,
$$
the above is a non-negative series. We expect this series to behave similar to 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{2}} \,.
$$ 
However
$$
\frac{1+\sin (n)}{n^{2}} \bigg/ \frac{1}{n^{2}}=1+\sin (n)
$$
does not converge. Hence, we cannot use the Limit Comparison Test.
In alternative, we note that
$$
\frac{1+\sin (n)}{n^{2}} \leq \frac{2}{n^{2}} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
The series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{n^{2}}

converges, being a $p$-series with $p=2>1$. Therefore also 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1+\sin (n)}{n^{2}}

### Ratio Test for positive series


The Ratio Test can be generalized to series. Notice that in this case the terms of the series need
to be positive.


::: Theorem  
### Ratio Test for positive series {#theorem-ratio-test-series}

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
a_{n}>0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \, .
$$

1. Suppose that the following limit exists:
$$
L:=\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} \,.
$$
They hold:

    - If $L<1$ then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges.

    - If $L>1$ then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ diverges.


2. Suppose that there exists $N \in \N$ and $L>1$ such that
$$
\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} \geq L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,. 
$$
Then the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ diverges.

:::

::: Proof

*Part 1.* Let 
$$
L:=\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} \,.
$$

- Suppose that $L<1$. Therefore there exists $r$ such that
$$
L < r < 1 \,.
$$
Define
$$
\e := r - L \,,
$$
so that $\e>0$. By the convergence $a_{n+1}/a_n \to L$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}-L\right| < \e = r - L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
In particular 
$$
\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}-L  <  r - L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
which implies 
$$
a_{n+1} <  r \, a_n  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Applying $n-N$ times the above estimate we get
$$
0 < a_{n} <  r  \, a_{n-1} < \ldots < r^{n-N} \, a_{N} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-limit-comparison-1}
Note that the series of $r^{n-N} \, a_{N}$ converges, since
$$
\sum_{n=N}^\infty r^{n-N} \, a_{N} = a_{N} \sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = a_N \frac{1}{1-r} \,,
$$
where the last equality follows because $\sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k$ is a geometric series and $0<r<1$. Since (@eq-limit-comparison-1) holds, by
the Comparison Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-comparison-test} we conclude that
the series
$$
\sum_{n=N}^\infty a_n
$$
converges. Therefore also the series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n 
$$
converges, ending the proof in the case $L<1$.

- Suppose $L>1$: Then, by the Ratio Test for sequences, it follows that $a_n$ diverges. Therefore 
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} \neq 0 \,,
$$ 
and the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty$ diverges by the Necessary Condition, see
Theorem \ref{theorem-series-necessary}.

*Part 2.* Suppose there exists $L>1$ and $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \geq L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
By the Ratio Test for sequences it follows that $a_n$ diverges. 
Therefore $\sum_{n=1}^\infty$ diverges by the Necessary Condition.

:::




::: Example 
Consider the series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(n !)^{2}}{(2 n) !}
$$
Let 
$$
a_{n}=\frac{(n !)^{2}}{(2 n) !}
$$ 
and compute
\begin{align*}
\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} & =\frac{((n+1) !)^{2}}{(2(n+1)) !} \bigg/ \frac{(n !)^{2}}{(2 n) !} \\
& = \frac{((n+1) !)^{2}}{(n !)^{2}} \frac{(2 n) !}{(2(n+1)) !} \\
& = \left(\frac{(n+1) !}{n !}\right)^{2} \frac{(2 n) !}{(2 n+2) !} \\
& = \frac{(n+1)^{2}}{(2 n+2)(2 n+1)} \\
& = \frac{\left(1+\dfrac{1}{n}\right)^{2}}{\left(2+\dfrac{2}{n}\right)\left(2+\dfrac{1}{n}\right)} 
\end{align*}
Therefore 
$$
L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = 
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\left(1+\dfrac{1}{n}\right)^{2}}{\left(2+\dfrac{2}{n}\right)\left(2+\dfrac{1}{n}\right)}  = \frac{1}{4} \,.
$$
Since $L = 1/4 <1$, be the Ratio Test for Series we conclude that the series of interest converges.

:::




::: Important

Like with the Ratio Test for sequences, the case $L=1$ is not covered by Theorem \ref{theorem-ratio-test-series}. This is because, in this case, the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
$$
might be convergent or divergent, as shown in the next example.

:::


::: Example

- Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$
Setting $a_n = 1/n$, we have
\begin{align*}
L & = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\
  & = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n+1} \bigg/ \frac{1}{n} \\
  & = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{n+1} = 1 \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore $L = 1$ and we cannot apply the Ratio Test. However the series in question diverges, being the harmonic series.


- Consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} \,.
$$
Setting $a_n = 1/n^2$, we have
\begin{align*}
L & = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\
  & = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{(n+1)^2} \bigg/ \frac{1}{n^2} \\
  & = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^2}{n^2 + 2n +1} = 1 \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore $L=1$ and we cannot apply the Ratio Test. However the series in question diverges, being
a $p$-series with $p = 2 >1$.


:::



The Ratio Test can often be combined with other convergence tests, as seen in the 
following example.


::: Example

Using the Cauchy Condensation Test and the Ratio Test, prove that the series below converges
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\log (n)}{ n^{2} } \,.
$$

>*Solution.* With $a_{n}=\log n / n^{2}$, we have
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{n} a_{2^{n}}
=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} 2^{n} \frac{\log (2^{n})}{\left(2^{n}\right)^{2}}
=\log (2) \, \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{n }{2^{n}}
$$
This converges according to the Ratio Test: With $b_{n}=n / 2^{n}$, we have
$$
\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}} \bigg/ \frac{n}{2^n} = \frac{n+1}{2n} \longrightarrow \frac12 < 1 \,.
$$
Hence $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\log n}{n^{2}}$ converges by the Cauchy Condensation Test.

## General series

In the previous section we presented several tests for non-negative series. 
For non-negative series we shows that the partial sums $(s_k)$ are increasing, see Lemma
\ref{lemma-partial-sums-increasing}. This makes non-negative terms series relatively easy to study. 

When a series contains both positive and negative terms, the partial sums
$(s_k)$ might oscillate, making the series harder to study. 
In this section we present some tests for general series in $\mathbb{C}$.


### Absolute Convergence Test


To study general series, we introduce a stronger notions of convergence,
known as **absolute convergence**.


::: Definition 
### Absolute convergence

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{C}$. The series 
$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ is said to **converge absolutely** if the non-negative series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|
$$
converges.

:::


Let us show that absolute convergence implies convergence.


::: Theorem
### Absolute Convergence Test    {#theorem-absolute-convergence-test}

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{C}$. If the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ converge absolutely, then the series converges.

:::

Before proceeding with the proof, we introduce some notation.

::: Notation
### Positive and negative part

For a number $x \in \R$, we define
$$
x^{+}:=
\begin{cases}
x & \mbox{ if } \, x \geq 0 \\
0 & \mbox{ if } \, x < 0 \\
\end{cases}  \qquad 
x^{-}:=
\begin{cases}
-x & \mbox{ if } \, x < 0 \\
0 & \mbox{ if } \, x \geq 0 \\
\end{cases} 
$$ 
These are called the **positive part** and **negative part** of $x$, respectively. Note that 
$$
x^+ \geq 0 \,, \quad x^{-} \geq 0 \,.
$$
Moreover they hold
$$
x = x^+ - x^- \,, \quad |x| = x^+ + x^- \,.
$$
The above relations are easy to check, and the proof is omitted. In particular, it holds that
$$
x^+ \leq |x| \,, \quad x^- \leq |x| \,.
$$


:::

::: Proof
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-absolute-convergence-test}

*Part 1.* Suppose first that $(a_n)$ is a sequence in $\R$ such that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|
$$
converges. Since 
$$
0 \leq a_{n}^{+} \leq\left|a_{n}\right| \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$ 
we can use the Comparison Test for non-negative series (Theorem \ref{theorem-comparison-test})
and conclude that the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}^{+} \,.
$$
converges. Similarly, we have
$$
0 \leq a_{n}^{-} \leq\left|a_{n}\right| \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$ 
Therefore also the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}^{-} 
$$
converges by the Comparison Test. Since 
$$
a_n = a_n^+ - a_n^- \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
we can use the Algebra of Limits for series (Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits-series}) to 
conclude that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n} =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}^{+}-a_{n}^{-}\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}^{+}-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}^{-}
$$
converges.


*Part 2.* Suppose now that $(a_n)$ is a sequence in $\C$ such that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|
$$
converges. Let $x_n, y_n \in \R$ denote the real and imaginary part of $a_n$.
Therefore
$$
|x_n| = \sqrt{x_n^2} \leq \sqrt{x_n^2 + y_n^2} = |a_n| \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Therefore the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty |x_n|
$$
converges by the Comparison Test for non-negative series (Theorem \ref{theorem-comparison-test}). 
Since $(x_n)$ is a real sequence, from Part 1 of the proof we have that the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n 
$$
converges. Arguing in the same way for the imaginary part $y_n$ we conclude that also
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty y_n 
$$
converges. Finally, by the Algebra of Limits in $\C$, we get
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( x_n + i y_n  \right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n + i \sum_{n=1}^\infty y_n \,,   
$$
proving that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges.

:::






::: Example 

The series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n} \frac{1}{n}
$$ 
does not converge absolutely, since
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|(-1)^{n} \frac{1}{n}\right|=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}
$$
doesn't converge, being the harmonic series.

:::


::: Example 

Prove that the following series converges 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n} \frac{n^{2}-5 n+2}{n^{4}} \,.
$$

> *Solution*. We have
$$
\left|(-1)^{n} \frac{n^{2}-5 n+2}{n^{4}}\right|=\frac{\left|n^{2}-5 n+2\right|}{n^{4}} \leq \frac{n^{2}+5 n+2}{n^{4}}
$$
where we used the triangle inequality. Note that
\begin{align*}
\frac{n^{2}+5 n+2}{n^{4}} \bigg/ \frac{1}{n^{2}} & =\frac{n^{4}+5 n^{3}+2 n^{2}}{n^{4}} \\
                                            & = 1+ \frac{5}{n} + \frac{2}{n^{2}} \longrightarrow 1
\end{align*}
The series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{2}}
$$ 
converges, being a $p$-series with $p=2$. Hence, also 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^{2}+5 n+2}{n^{4}}
$$ 
converges by the Limit Comparison Test for non-negative series (Theorem \ref{theorem-limit-comparison-test}). Since 
\begin{align*}
0 \leq \left|(-1)^{n} \frac{n^{2}-5 n+2}{n^{4}}\right|  & = \frac{\left|n^{2}-5 n+2\right|}{n^{4}}  \\
  & \leq \frac{n^{2}+5 n+2}{n^{4}} \,,
\end{align*} 
the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|(-1)^{n} \frac{n^{2}-5 n+2}{n^{4}}\right|
$$
converges by the Comparison Test for non-negative series (Theorem \ref{theorem-comparison-test}). 
This shows the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n} \frac{n^{2}-5 n+2}{n^{4}}
$$
converges by the Absolute Convergence Test.

### Ratio Test for general series



As an application of the Absolute Convergence Test we obtain the Ratio Test for general series.


::: Theorem 
### Ratio Test for general series  {#theorem-ratio-test-general}

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{C}$, such that
$$

$$

1. Suppose that the following limit exists:
$$
L:=\lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| \,.
$$
They hold:

    - If $L<1$ then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges absolutely, and hence converges.

    - If $L>1$ then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ diverges.


2. Suppose that there exists $N \in \N$ and $L>1$ such that
$$
\left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} \right| \geq L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,. 
$$
Then the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ diverges.

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* Let
$$
b_{n} := \left|a_{n}\right| \,,

so that 
$$
L:= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| 
  = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{b_{n+1}}{b_{n}} \,. 
$$

- Suppose that $L<1$. Since $(b_n)$ is a sequence with non-negative terms, we have that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}
$$ 
converges by the Ratio Test for non-negative series, see Theorem \ref{theorem-ratio-test-series}. Since, by definition
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|
$$
also the latter series converges, i.e., $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ converges absolutely. In particular $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ converges, by the Absolute Convergence Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-absolute-convergence-test}.

- Suppose that $L>1$. Then the sequence $(a_n)$ diverges by the Ratio
Test for sequences. Hence the series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
$$
diverges by the Necessary Condition in Theorem \ref{theorem-series-necessary}.


*Part 2.* If there exists $N \in \N$ and $L>1$ such that
$$
\left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} \right| \geq L \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
then the sequence $(a_n)$ diverges by the Ratio
Test for sequences, and we conclude as above.

Then
\begin{align*}
L & := \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| \\

& =\left|\frac{(4-3 i)^{n+1}}{((n+1)+1) !} \bigg/ \frac{(4-3 i)^{n}}{(n+1) !}\right| \\
& = \frac{|4-3 i|^{n+1}}{|4-3 i|^{n}} \frac{(n+1) !}{(n+2) !} \\ 
& = \frac{5}{n+2}  \\
& = 0

By the Ratio Test we conclude that the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$
converges absolutely, and hence converges.

### Exponential function and Euler's Number

We have already encountered the exponential function in the Euler's identity
$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin (\theta) \,, \quad \, \theta \in \R \,.

Using the Ratio Test for general series, we can give a precise definition 
for $e^z$ with $z \in \C$. We start by studying convergence of the exponential series.


::: Theorem 
### Exponential series

Let $z \in \mathbb{C}$. The **exponential series**

$$
a_{n}=\frac{z^{n}}{n !} \,.
$$
Then
\begin{align*}
L & = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right| \\
  & =  \lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{z^{n+1}}{(n+1) !} \bigg/ \frac{z^{n}}{n !}\right| \\
  & =  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{|z|^{n+1}}{|z|^{n}} \frac{n !}{(n+1) !} \\
  & =  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{|z|}{n+1} \\
  & =    |z| \cdot \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n+1} = 0 \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore the series converges absolutely by the Ratio Test in Theorem \ref{theorem-ratio-test-general}.

$$
e^{z} := \exp(z) \,, \quad e:=e^{1} \,.

:::


::: Remark

1. Using the definition of $e^z$, one can show the usual properties of exponentials, such that
$$
e^{x+y}=e^{x} e^{y} \,, \quad \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} e^{x}=e^{x} \,.

e := \lim_{n \to \infty } \left( 1 + \frac1n  \right)^n \,.

Using the binomial theorem one can prove that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty } \left( 1 + \frac1n  \right)^n = 
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n !} \,.

### Conditional convergence

Some series do not converge absolutely, but still converge. Such series are said to converge conditionally.

::: Definition 
### Conditional convergence

Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence in $\C$. We say that the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}
$$ 
converges **conditionally** if it converges, but it does not converge
absolutely.

:::


In practice conditional convergence means that the convergence of the series depends on the order in which we perform the summation. Changing the
order of summation of a series is called rearrangement.





::: Definition
### Rearrangement of a series

Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence in $\C$. We define:

- A **permutation** is a bijection $\sigma \colon \N \to \N$. 
- A **rearrangement** of the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is a series
$$
\sum_{n=1 }^\infty a_{\sigma(n)}
$$
for some permutation $\sigma$.

:::


If a series of complex numebers converges absolutely, 
then all its rearrangements converge to the same limit.

::: Theorem

Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence in $\C$ such that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|
$$
converges. For any permutation $\sigma$ we have
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(n)}  = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n  \, .
$$

:::

For a proof, see Theorem 3.55 in [@rudin_introduction]. A very surprising result is the following: If a series of real numbers converges 
conditionally, then the series can be rearranged to converge to
any real number.


::: Theorem
### Riemann rearrangement Theorem

Let $(a_n)$ be a real series such that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
$$
converges conditionally. Let 
$$ 
L \in \R \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, L = \pm \infty  \,.
$$
There exists a permutation $\sigma$ such that the corresponding rearrangement $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(n)}$ converges
conditionally to $L$, that is, 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(n)}  = L  \, .
$$

For a proof, we refer the reader to Theorem 3.54 in [@rudin_introduction].




### Dirichlet and Alternating Series Tests



There are very few conditional convergence tests available. We present
the Dirichlet Test and the Alternating Series Test.


::: Theorem
### Dirichlet Test

Let $(c_n)$ be a sequence in $\C$ and $(q_n)$ a sequence in $\R$.
Suppose that 

- $q_n$ is decreasing, 
- $q_n \to 0$,
- $q_n \geq 0$ for all $n \in \N$. 
- Suppose there exists $M > 0$ such that
$$
\left|  \sum_{n=1}^k c_n \right| \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, k \in \N \,.
$$

Then the following series converges
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n q_n
$$

:::


::: Proof 

Define the partial sums
$$
s_k := \sum_{n=1}^k c_n \,, \quad \forall \, k \in \N \,.
$$
By assumption it holds
$$
|s_k| \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, k \in \N \,.
$${#eq-dirichlet-test-proof}
Note that 
\begin{align*}
c_1 & = s_1 \\ 
c_2 & = s_2 - s_1 \\
& \ldots  \ldots \\ 
c_n & = s_{n} - s_{n-1} \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^k c_k q_k & = c_1 q_1 + c_2 q_2 + \ldots + c_k q_k \\
                     & = s_1 q_1 + (s_2 - s_1) q_2 + \ldots + (s_k - s_{k-1})q_k \\
                     & = s_1 (q_1 - q_2) + s_2 (q_2 - q_3) + \ldots +
                         s_{k-1} (q_{k-1} - q_k) + s_k q_k \\
                     & = \left( \sum_{n=1}^{k-1} s_n (q_n - q_{n+1}) \right) + s_k q_k
\end{align*}
Since $(s_k)$ is bounded and $q_k \to 0$, we conclude that
$$
s_k q_k \to 0 \,.
$$
Further, notice that
$$
q_n - q_{n+1} \geq 0 \,,
$$
since $q_n$ is decreasing. Therefore, using (@eq-dirichlet-test-proof), we get
\begin{align*}
|s_n| |q_n -  q_{n+1}| & = |s_n| (q_n -  q_{n+1}) \\
                       & \leq M (q_n -  q_{n+1})
\end{align*}
for all $n \in \N$. Note that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} M (q_n -  q_{n+1}) = M (q_1 - q_{k}) \,.
$$
Since $q_k \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$, we conclude that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} M (q_n -  q_{n+1}) = M q_1 \,.
$$
Hence, by the Comparison Test for non-negative series, we infer
that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty  |s_n| |q_n -  q_{n+1}|  \,.
$$
In particular the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty  s_n (q_n -  q_{n+1})
$$
converges by the Absolute Convergence Test. Since we have shown
$$
\sum_{n=1}^k c_k q_k = \left( \sum_{n=1}^{k-1} s_n (q_n - q_{n+1}) \right) + s_k q_k
$$
and $s_k q_k \to 0$, we conclude that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_k q_k  
$$
converges.

::: Example

Let $\theta \in \R$, with 
$$
\theta \neq 2 k \pi \,, \quad \forall \, k \in \Z \,.
$$
Prove that the below series are conditionally convergent
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{i \theta n}}{n} \,, \quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(\theta n)}{n} \,, \quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(\theta n)}{n} \,.
$$

> *Solution.* Clearly the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{i \theta n}}{n}
$$
does not converge absolutely, since 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left| \frac{e^{i \theta n}}{n} \right| 
= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}
$$
diverges, being the Harmonic Series. Let us prove convergence of
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{i \theta n}}{n}$.
Define the sequences
$$
c_n := e^{i\theta n} \,, \quad q_n := \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$
We have that $q_n$ is decreasing, $q_n \to 0$ and $q_n \geq 0$. 
Let us prove that there exists $M>0$ such that
$$
\left| \sum_{n=1}^k  e^{i\theta n} \right| \leq M \,,\quad \forall \, k \in \N \,. 
$${#eq-dirichlet-example}
Note that
$$
1 - e^{i\theta} \neq 0 \,,
$$
since $\theta \neq 2k\pi$ for all $k \in \Z$. Therefore we can use the
Geometric Series (truncated) summation formula to get
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^k  e^{i\theta n} & = \sum_{n=1}^k  e^{i\theta n} \\
                            & = \frac{1- e^{i(k+1)\theta}}{1 - e^{i\theta}} - 1 \\
                            & = e^{i\theta} \, 
                            \frac{1- e^{ik\theta}}{1 - e^{i\theta}}
\end{align*}
Thus
\begin{align*}
\left| \sum_{n=1}^k  e^{i\theta n} \right| & = \left| e^{i\theta} \, 
                            \frac{1- e^{ik\theta}}{1 - e^{i\theta}} \right| \\
                            & = \left| e^{i \theta} \right|
                            \left|\frac{1- e^{ik\theta}}{1 - e^{i\theta}} \right| \\
                            & = \frac{ |1- e^{ik\theta}|}{|1 - e^{i\theta} |} \\
                            & \leq \frac{ |1| + |e^{ik\theta}|}{|1 - e^{i\theta} |} \\
                            & =  \frac{ |1| }{|1 - e^{i\theta} |}
\end{align*}
where we used the triangle inequality. Since the right hand side does not
depend on $k$, we can set
$$
M := \frac{ |1| }{|1 - e^{i\theta} |} \,,
$$
so that (@eq-dirichlet-example) holds. Therefore 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{i \theta n}}{n}
$$
converges by the Dirichlet Test. Recalling the Euler's Identity
$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta) \,,
$$
we obtain that also the series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos(n \theta)}{n} \,, \quad 
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin(n \theta)}{n}
$$
converge. 

:::


As a corollary of the Dirichlet Test we obtain the Alternate Convergence
Test.




::: Theorem 
### Alternate Convergence Test

Let $(q_n)$ be a sequence in $\R$ such that 

- $q_n$ is decreasing, 
- $q_n \to 0$,
- $q_n \geq 0$ for all $n \in \N$. 

The following series converges
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n q_n
$$

:::


::: Proof

Define the sequence
$$
c_n := (-1)^n \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^k c_n = 
\begin{cases}
0  &  \,\, \mbox{ if } \,\, k \, \mbox{ even} \\
-1  &  \,\, \mbox{ if } \,\, k \, \mbox{ odd} \\
\end{cases}
$$
Hence
$$
\left| \sum_{n=1}^k c_n \right| \leq 1 \,, \quad  \forall \, k \in \N \,.
$$
By the Dirichlet Test we have convergence of
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n q_n = 
\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n q_n  \,.
$$

:::



::: {.Example  #example-alternating-series-test}

Prove that the below series converges conditionally
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n} \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$

>*Solution.* The series does not converge absolutely, since
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left| (-1)^{n} \frac{1}{n} \right| =
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1n
$$
diverges, being the Harmonic Series. We need to show convergence of
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n} \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$
To this end, set 
$$
q_n := \frac1n \,.
$$
Clearly $q_n \geq 0$, $q_n \to 0$ and $q_n$ is decreasing. Hence the series
converges by the Alternating Series Test.

:::




### Abel's Test


Another conditional convergence test is the Abel Test. This looks similar
to the Dirichlet Test, however notice that the Abel Test only deals 
with real sequences.


::: Theorem
### Abel's Test

Let $(a_n)$ and $(q_n)$ be sequences in $\R$.
Suppose that 

- $q_n$ is monotone, 
- $q_n$ is bounded,
- The series below converges
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \,.
$$

Then the following series converges
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n q_n
$$


:::


The proof is similar to the one of the Dirichlet Test. We decided to omit it.


::: Example

Prove that the series below converges conditionally
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \ \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \,.
$$

> *Solution.* Set 
$$
a_n:= \frac{(-1)^n}{n}\,, \quad q_n := \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \,.
$$
We have seen that $q_n$ is monotone increasing and bounded. Moreover the
series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges by the Alternating Series Test, 
as seen in Example \ref{example-alternating-series-test}. Hence the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n q_n$ converges by the Abel Test.
>
>However the series in question does not converge absolutely. Indeed, 
$$
\left|\frac{(-1)^n}{n} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \right| = 
\frac{1}{n} q_n \geq  \frac{1}{n} q_1 \,,
$$
since $(q_n)$ is increasing. As the series 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} q_1
$$
diverges, by the Comparison Test we conclude that also 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left|\frac{(-1)^n}{n} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \right|
$$
diverges, proving that the series in the example converges conditionally.
