# Complex Numbers

In @sec-existence-roots, we have proven the existence of $\sqrt{x}$ for all for $x \geq 0$. The number $\sqrt{x}$ was defined as
$$
\sqrt{x}:= \alpha \,, \quad \alpha := \sup \{ t \in \R \divider t^2 < x  \}\,.
$$
We then proved that
$$
\alpha^2 = x \,.
$$
This procedure is possible for any $x \geq 0$.

::: Question
Is there a number $\alpha \in \R$ such that 
$$
\alpha^{2}=-1  \,\, ?
$${#eq-complex-intro-1}
:::

The answer to the above question is no. This is because $\R$ is an ordered field, and from axiom (MO) it follows that:
$$
x^2 \geq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, x \in \R \,.
$$
However we would still like to solve equation (@eq-complex-intro-1) somehow. To do this, we introduce the **imaginary numbers** or **complex numbers**. We define $i$ to be that *number* such that
$$
i^{2}=-1 \,.
$$
Formally, we can also think of $i$ as 
$$
i =\sqrt{-1} \,.
$$ 
We can use this speacial number to define the square root of a negative real number $x<0$:
$$
\sqrt{x}: = i \sqrt{-x} \,.
$$
Note that $\sqrt{-x}$ is properly defined in $\mathbb{R}$, because $-x$ is positive when $x$ is negative.


## The field $\C$

We would like to be able to do calculations with the newly introduced complex numbers, and investigate their properties. We can introduce them
rigorously as a field, as we did for $\mathbb{R}$. 


::: Definition
### Complex Numbers

The set of complex numbers $\C$ is defined as

$$
\C := \R \oplus i \R  := \{x \oplus i y  \divider x, y \in \R \} \,.
$$

:::

In the above the symbol $\oplus$ is used to denote the pair
$$
x \oplus i y = (x,y)
$$
with $x,y \in \R$. This means that $x$ and $y$ play different *roles*.


::: Definition

For a complex number
$$
z = x \oplus i y  \in \C
$$
we say that

- $x$ is the **real part** of $z$, and denote it by 
$$
x = \Re (z)
$$
- $y$ is the **imaginary part** of $z$, and denote it by 
$$
y = \Im (z)
$$

We say that

- If $\Re z = 0$ then $z$ is a **purely imaginary** number.
- If $\Im z = 0$ then $z$ is a **real** number.

:::


In order to make the set $\mathbb{C}$ into a field, we first have to define the two binary operations of addition $+$ and multiplication $\cdot$, 
$$
+ , \cdot \,\, \colon \C \times \C \to \C \,.
$$
Then we need to prove that these operations satisfy all the field axioms.


::: Definition
### Addition in $\C$   {#definition-addition-C}

Let $z_1,z_2 \in \C$, so that 
$$
z_1 = x_1 \oplus i y_1 \,\,, \quad z_2 = x_2 \oplus i  y_2 \,\, ,
$$
for some $x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2 \in \R$. We define the sum of $z_1$ and
$z_2$ as
$$
z_1 + z_2 = \left( x_{1} \oplus i y_{1} \right)+ \left(x_{2} \oplus i y_{2} \right):=\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right) \oplus i  \left(y_{1}+y_{2}\right) 
$$
where the $+$ symbol on the right hand side is the addition operator in $\mathbb{R}$. 

:::

Clearly, $z_1 + z_2$ as defined above is an element of $\C$. Therefore
$+$ defines a binary operation over $\C$.


::: Notation

From the above definition, we have that, for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, 

$$
(x \oplus i 0 )+(0 \oplus i y)= x \oplus i y .
$$
To simplify notation, we will write 
$$
x \oplus i 0 = x \,, \quad \,  0 \oplus i y  = i y 
$$ 
and 
$$
x \oplus i y = x + i y \,.
$$
We will also often swap $i$ and $y$, writing equivalently
$$
x + i y = x + y i \,.
$$


:::


We now want to define multiplication between complex numbers. 


::: Remark 
### Formal calculation for multiplication in $\C$  {#remark-formal-multiplication}

How to define multiplication in $\C$? Whatever the definition may be, 
at least it has to give that
that 
$$
i^{2}=i \cdot i=-1 \,.
$$
Keeping the above in mind, let us do some formal calculations: 
For $z_1 = x_1 + i y_1, z_2 = x_2 + i y_2$ we have

\begin{align*}
z_1 \cdot z_2 & = \left(x_{1}+i y_{1}  \right) \cdot \left(x_{2}+ i y_{2} \right) \\
& = x_{1} \cdot x_{2} + x_{1} \cdot i y_{2} + x_{2} \cdot i y_{1} + y_{1} \cdot i^2 y_{2}   \\
& = \left(x_{1} \cdot x_{2} - y_{1} \cdot y_{2} \right) + i \left(x_{1} \cdot y_{2} + x_{2} \cdot y_{1} \right)  
\end{align*}

:::

Remark \ref{remark-formal-multiplication} motivates the following definition of multiplication.


::: Definition
### Multiplication in $\C$   {#definition-multiplication-C}

Let $z_1,z_2 \in \C$, so that 
$$
z_1 = x_1 \oplus i y_1 \,\,, \quad z_2 = x_2 \oplus i  y_2 \,\, ,
$$
for some $x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2 \in \R$. Define the multiplication of 
$z_1$ and $z_2$ as 
\begin{align*}
z_1 \cdot z_2 & = \left(x_{1}+i y_{1} \right) \cdot\left(x_{2}+ i y_{2} \right) \\
              & := \left(x_{1} \cdot x_{2} - y_{1} \cdot y_{2}\right) + i \left(x_{1} \cdot y_{2} + x_{2} \cdot y_{1} \right) \,,
\end{align*}
where the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ on the right hand side are the operations in $\R$.

:::

Clearly, $z_1 \cdot z_2$ as defined above is an element of $\C$. Therefore
$\cdot$ defines a binary operation over $\C$.



::: {.Remark #remark-complex-i}

To check that we have given a good definition of product, we should
have that
$$
i^2 = - 1\,,
$$
as expected. Indeed:

\begin{align*}
i^{2} & = (0+ 1 i) \cdot (0+ 1 i) \\
      & = (0 \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot 1) + (0 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 1) i = - 1 \,.
\end{align*}
:::



::: Important

In view of Remark \ref{remark-complex-i}, we see that he formal calculations in Remark \ref{remark-formal-multiplication} are compatible with 
the definition of multiplication of complex numbers. Therefore, it is not necessary to memorize the multiplication formula, but it suffices to carry out calculations as usual, and replace $i^{2}$ by $-1$.

:::




::: Example

**Question.** Compute $zw$, where
$$
z =  -2+3 i \,, \quad w = 1- i \,.
$$

**Solution.** Using the definition we compute
\begin{align*}
z \cdot w & = (-2+3 i) \cdot (1 -  i) \\ 
            & = (-2-(-3))+(2+3) i \\
            & = 1 + 5 i \, .
\end{align*}
Alternatively, we can proceed formally as in Remark 
\ref{remark-formal-multiplication}. We just need to recall that
$i^2$ has to be replaced with $-1$:
\begin{align*}
z \cdot w & = (-2+3 i) \cdot (1 -  i) \\ 
            & = - 2 + 2i + 3i - 3 i^2  \\
            & = (-2  + 3 ) + (  2 + 3 ) i \\
            & = 1 + 5 i \, .
\end{align*}

:::



We now want to check that 
$$
(\C, + , \cdot)
$$
is a field. All the field axioms are trivial to check, except for
the existence of additive and multiplicative inverses.


::: Proposition
### Additive inverse in $\C$  {#proposition-C-additive-inverse}

The neutral element of addition in $\C$ is the number
$$
0 := 0 + 0 i \,.
$$
For any $z = x + i y \in \C$, the unique additive inverse is given by
$$
- z := -x - i y \,.
$$


:::


The proof is immediate and is left as an exercise. The multiplication
requires more care. 


::: Remark
### Formal calculation for multiplicative inverse  {#remark-formal-inverse}

Let us first carry our some formal 
calculations. Let 
$$
z = x+iy \in \C \,, \quad z \neq 0 \,.
$$
First, note that 
$$
z \cdot 1 = (x + iy) \cdot (1 + 0 i)  = x + iy = z \,,
$$
and therefore $1$ is the neutral element of multiplication.
Thus, the inverse of $z$ should be a complex number $z^{-1} \in \C$ 
such that
$$
z \cdot z^{-1} = 1 \,.
$$
We would like to define
$$
z^{-1} = \frac{1}{x + iy} \,.
$$
Such number does not belong to $\C$, as it is not of
the form $a + ib$ for some $a,b \in \R$. However it is what 
the inverse should look like. Proceeding formally:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{x+ i y} & = \frac{1}{x+ iy} \cdot 1 \\
                & = \frac{1}{x+ i y} \cdot \frac{x- i y}{x - i y} \\
                & =\frac{x - i y}{x^{2}-(iy)^{2}} \\
                & =\frac{x- iy}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \\
                & = \frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \,.
\end{align*}
The right hand side is an element of $\C$, and looks like a good candidate for $z^{-1}$.

:::

Motivated by the above remark, we define inverses in $\C$ in the following way.

::: Proposition
### Multiplicative inverse in $\C$  {#proposition-C-multiplicative-inverse}

The neutral element of multiplication in $\C$ is the number
$$
1 := 1 + 0 i \,.
$$
For any $z = x + i y \in \C$, the unique multiplicative inverse is given by 
$$
z^{-1} := \frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+ i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof
It is immediate to check that $1$ is the neutral element of 
multiplication in $\C$. For the remaining part of the statement, set
$$
w := \frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+ i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \,.
$$
We need to check that $z \cdot w = 1$
\begin{align*}
z \cdot w & = (x+i y) \cdot \left(\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+ i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \right) \\
& = \left(\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}} - \frac{y \cdot(-y)}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\right) + i \, \left(\frac{x \cdot(-y)}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+\frac{x y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\right) \\
& =1 \,,
\end{align*}
so indeed $z^{-1}=w$.

:::


::: Important

It is not necessary to memorize the formula for $z^{-1}$. Indeed one can just remember the trick of multiplying by 
$$
1 = \frac{x - iy }{x - iy} \,,
$$
and proceed formally, as done in Remark \ref{remark-formal-inverse}.

:::

::: Example

**Question.** Let $z = 3 + 2 i$. Compute $z^{-1}$. 


**Solution.** By the formula in Propostion \ref{proposition-C-multiplicative-inverse} we immediately get
$$
z^{-1} = \frac{3}{3^{2}+2^{2}} +  \, \frac{-2}{3^{2}+2^{2}} \, i = 
\frac{3}{13}-\frac{2}{13} \, i  \,.
$$
Alternatively, we can proceed formally as in Remark \ref{remark-formal-inverse}
\begin{align*}
(3+2 i)^{-1} & = \frac{1}{3+2 i} \\ 
             & = \frac{1}{3+2 i} \, \frac{3-2 i}{3-2 i} \\
             & = \frac{3-2 i}{3^2+2^2} \\
             & = \frac{3}{13}-\frac{2}{13} i  \,,
\end{align*}
and obtain the same result.
:::



We can now prove that $\C$ is a field.

::: Theorem 

$(\C,+, \cdot)$ is a field.

:::


::: Proof

We need to check that all field axioms hold. For the addition we have

- (A1) To show that $+$ is commutative, note that
\begin{align*}
(x+iy)+(a+ ib) & = (x+a)+ i (y+b) \\
               & = (a + x)+ i (b+y) \\
               & = (a + i b ) + (x + i y) \,,
\end{align*}
where we used Definition \ref{definition-addition-C} in the first and last equality, and the commutative property of the real numbers (which holds since by definition $\R$ is a field) in the second equality. Associativity can be checked in the same way.

- (A2) The neutral element of addition is $0$, as stated in Proposition \ref{proposition-C-additive-inverse}.

- (A3) Existence of additive inverses is given by Proposition \ref{proposition-C-additive-inverse}.


For multiplication we have:

- (M1) Commutativity and associativity of product in $\C$ can be checked
using Definition \ref{definition-multiplication-C} and commutativity and associativity of sum and multiplication in $\R$.

- (M2) The neutral element of multiplication is $1$, as stated in 
Propostion \ref{proposition-C-multiplicative-inverse}.

- (M3) Existence of multiplicative inverses is guaranteed by Proposition \ref{proposition-C-multiplicative-inverse}.

Finally one should check the associative property (AM). This is left as
an exercise.

### Division in $\C$


Suppose we want to divide two complex numbers $w,z \in \mathbb{C}, z \neq 0$, with
$$
z = x + i y \,, \quad w = a + ib \,.
$$
We have two options:

1. Use the formula for the inverse from Proposition \ref{proposition-C-multiplicative-inverse} and compute
$$
z^{-1} := \frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+ i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \,.
$$
Then we use the multiplication formula of Definition \ref{definition-multiplication-C} to compute
\begin{align*}
\frac{w}{z} & = w \cdot z^{-1} \\
            & = (a + i b) \, \cdot \left( \frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}+ i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}   \right) \\
            & = \frac{ (ax + by) + i (bx - ay) }{ x^2 + y^2 }
\end{align*}

2. Proceed formally as in Remark \ref{remark-formal-inverse}, using the 
multiplication by $1$ trick. We would have
\begin{align*}
\frac{w}{z} & = \frac{ a + i b }{ x + i y } \\
            & = \frac{ a + i b }{ x + i y } \, \frac{ x - i y }{ x - i y } \\
            & = \frac{ (ax + by) + i (bx - ay) }{ x^2 + y^2 }
\end{align*}



::: Example

**Question.** Let $w=1+i$ and $z=3-i$. Compute $\frac{w}{z}$.

**Solution.** We compute $w/z$ using the two options we have:

1. Using the formula for the inverse from Proposition \ref{proposition-C-multiplicative-inverse} we compute
\begin{align*}
z^{-1} & = \frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}} + i \, \frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \\
       & = \frac{3}{3^2 + 1^2} - i \, \frac{-1}{3^2 + 1^2} \\
       & = \frac{3}{10} + \frac{1}{10} \, i
\end{align*}
and therefore
\begin{align*}
\frac{w}{z} & = w \cdot z^{-1} \\
            & = (1 + i) \, \left(  \frac{3}{10} + \frac{1}{10} \, i \right) \\
            & = \left(\frac{3}{10}-\frac{1}{10}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{10}+\frac{3}{10}\right) i \\
            & = \frac{2}{10}+\frac{4}{10} i \\
            & = \frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5} i
\end{align*}

2. We proceed formally, using the 
multiplication by $1$ trick. We have
\begin{align*}
\frac{w}{z} & = \frac{1+i}{3-i}  \\
            & = \frac{1+i}{3-i} \frac{3+i}{3+i} \\
            & = \frac{3-1+(3+1) i}{3^2+1^2} \\
            & =\frac{2}{10}+\frac{4}{10} i \\
            & = \frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5} i
\end{align*}

### $\C$ is not ordered

We have seen that $(\C,+,\cdot)$ is a field. One might wonder whether $\C$ is also an ordered field. It turns out that this is not the case.

::: {.Theorem #theorem-C-order}

The field $(\C,+,\cdot)$ is not ordered.

:::


::: Proof
Suppose that $\C$ is an ordered field, that is, there 
exists an order relation $\leq$ on $\C$ compatible with 
the operations $+$ and $\cdot$. By axiom (MO) it follows that for all elements $z \in \C, z \neq 0$, we have that $z^{2}>0$. But since $i^{2}=-1<0$, we get a contradiction.

:::

Hence, it is not possible to compare two complex numbers.



### Completeness of $\C$

One might also wonder whether $\C$ is complete. Our definition of completeness uses the notions of supremum and infimum, which require an order relation. However, $\C$ is not ordered, as seen in Theorem \ref{theorem-C-order}. Therefore we cannot define infimum and supremum of subsets of $\C$, and we have to find an alternative way to discuss completeness.

The right way to introduce completeness in $\C$ is by using the notion of **Cauchy sequence**. In ordered fields, this new definition of completeness is equivalent to the definition which uses the supremum. 






## Complex conjugates


When computing inverses, we used the trick to multiply by $1$:
$$
z^{-1} = \frac{1}{z} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{x + i y}  \cdot \frac{x-iy}{x-iy} \,.
$$
The complex number $x-iy$ is obtained by changing the sign to the
imaginary part of $z = x+iy$. We give a name to this operation.

::: Definition 
### Complex conjugate

Let $z=x+iy$. We call the **complex conjugate** of $z$, denoted by $\bar{z}$, the complex number

$$
\bar{z}=x- i y \, .
$$


:::



::: Example 

We have the following conjugates:
\begin{align*}
&\overline{3+4 i}  = 3 - 4 i \, , & \quad & \overline{3-4 i} = 3+4 i\,, \\
& \overline{-3+4 i}  = -3 - 4 i \,, & \quad & \overline{-3-4 i}=-3+4 i \,, \\ & \overline{3}  = 3 \, , & \quad & \overline{4 i}=-4 i \, .
\end{align*}

:::



Complex conjugates have the following properties:


::: Theorem 

For all $z_1, z_2 \in \mathbb{C}$ it holds:

- $\overline{z_1 +  z_2 }=\overline{z_1}+\overline{z_2}$

- $\overline{z_1 \cdot z_2}=\overline{z_1} \cdot \overline{z_2}$ 

:::


::: Proof
Let $z_{1}, z_{2} \in \C$. Then 
$$
z_{1}=x_{1}+i y_{1}  \,, \quad  z_{2} = x_{2} + i y_{2}  \,, 
$$
for some $x_{1}, y_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2} \in \R$.

- Using the definition of addition in $\C$ and of conjugate,
\begin{align*}
\overline{z_{1}+z_{2}} & =\overline{\left(x_{1}+i y_{1} \right)+\left(x_{2}+ i y_{2} \right)} \\ 
& =\overline{\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right)+ i \left(y_{1}+y_{2}\right)} \\
& =\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right)- i \left(y_{1}+y_{2}\right) \\
& =\left(x_{1}- i y_{1} \right) +  \left(x_{2}-i y_{2} \right) \\
& =\overline{x_{1}+ i y_{1} } + \overline{x_{2}+i y_{2} } \\
& =\overline{z_{1}}+\overline{z_{2}} \,.
\end{align*}

- Using the definition of multiplication in $\C$ and of conjugate,

\begin{align*}
\overline{z_{1} \cdot z_{2}} & = \overline{\left(x_{1}+i y_{1} \right) \cdot\left(x_{2}+ i y_{2} \right)} \\
& = \overline{\left(x_{1} x_{2}-y_{1} y_{2}\right)+ i \left(x_{1} y_{2}+x_{2} y_{1}\right)} \\
& = \left(x_{1} x_{2}-y_{1} y_{2}\right)- i \left(x_{1} y_{2}+x_{2} y_{1}\right)  \\
& =\left(x_{1}-i y_{1} \right) \cdot\left(x_{2}- i y_{2} \right) \\
& =\overline{z_{1}} \cdot \overline{z_{2}}
\end{align*}

:::




::: Example
Let $z_{1}=3-4 i$ and $z_{2}=-2+5 i$. Then

- Let us check that
$$
\overline{z_{1}+z_{2}}=\overline{z_{1}}+\overline{z_{2}}
$$
Indeed, we have
$$
z_1 + z_2 = 1 + i  \quad \implies \quad \overline{z_1 + z_2} = 1 - i \, .
$$
On the other hand
$$
\overline{z_{1}} =  3 + 4i \,, \quad 
\overline{z_{2}} = -2 -5i \quad \implies \quad
\overline{z_{1}} + \overline{z_{2}}= 1-i \,.
$$

- Let us check that
$$
\overline{z_{1} \cdot z_{2}}=\overline{z_{1}} \cdot \overline{z_{2}}
$$
Indeed, 
\begin{align*}
z_{1} \cdot z_{2} & = (3+4i) \cdot (-2 + 5i) \\
                  & = (- 6 + 20)+ (8 + 15 )i \\
                  & = 14 + 23 i
\end{align*}
so that
$$
\overline{z_{1} \cdot z_{2}} = 14 - 23 i
$$
On the other hand:
\begin{align*}
\overline{z_{1}} \cdot \overline{z_{2}} & =(3+4 i) \cdot(-2-5 i) \\
                                        & = (-6+20)+(-15-8) i \\
                                        & = 14 - 23 i
\end{align*}

## The complex plane

We can represent a real number $x$ as a point on the one-dimensional real line $\R$. The distance between two real numbers $x, y \in \R$ on the real line is given by $|x-y|$, see @fig-real-line. 

![Two points $x$ and $y$ on the real line $\R$. Their distance is $|x-y|$.](/images/real_line.png){#fig-real-line width=70%}



We would like to do something similar for the complex numbers, i.e. points
$$
z = x + iy \,, \quad x , \, y \in \R\,.
$$
We represent $z= x + i y$ in the two-dimensional plane at the point with (Cartesian) coordinates $(x, y)$. This two-dimensional plane in which we can represent all complex numbers is called the **complex plane**. The 
origin of such plane, with coordinates $(0,0)$, corresponds to the  complex number 
$$
0+0 i = 0 \,,
$$
see @fig-complex-plane. 

![A point $z = x + iy \in \C$ can be represented on the complex plane by the point of coordinates $(x,y)$. The distance between $z$ and $0$ is given by $|z| = \sqrt{z^2 + y^2}$. ](/images/complex_plane.png){#fig-complex-plane width=60%}


### Distance on $\C$

The Cartesian representation allows us to introduce a distance between two complex numbers. Let us start with the distance between a complex number $z=x+i y$ and $0$. By Pythagoras Theorem this distance is given by 
$$
\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} \,,
$$
see @fig-complex-plane. We give a name to this quantity.

::: Definition
### Modulus

The **modulus** of a complex number $z=x+i y$ is defined by
$$
|z|: = \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} \,.
$$
:::

Note that the distance between $z$ and $0$ is always a non-negative number. 



::: Remark
### Modulus of Real numbers

A real number $x \in \R$ can be written as 
$$
x = x+ 0 i \in \C \,.
$$ 
Hence the modulus of $x$ is given by 
$$
|x|=\sqrt{x^{2}+0^{2}}=\sqrt{x^{2}} \,.
$$
The above coincides with the absolute value of $x$. This explains why the notation for modulus in $\C$ is the same as the one for absolute value in $\R$.

:::



We can now define the distance between two complex numbers.

::: Definition
### Distance in $\C$

Given $z_1,z_2 \in \C$, we define the **distance** between $z_1$ and 
$z_2$ as the quantity
$$
|z_1 - z_2| \,.
$$

:::

The geometric intuition of why the quantity $|z_1 - z_2|$ is defined as the distance between $z_1$ and $z_2$ is given in @fig-complex-plane-distance.

![The difference $z_1 - z_2$ of the two points $z_1,z_2 \in \C$ is given by the magenta vector. We define $|z_1-z_2|$ as the distance between $z_1$ and $z_2$. ](/images/complex_plane_distance.png){#fig-complex-plane-distance width=60%}


::: Theorem

Given $z_1,z_2 \in \C$, we have
$$
|z_1 - z_2|  = \sqrt{ (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 }  \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof


We have
$$
z_1 - z_2 = (x_1 - x_2) + i (y_1 - y_2) \,.
$$
Therefore, by definition of modulus,
$$
|z_1 - z_2|  = \sqrt{ (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 } \,.
$$

:::



::: Example

**Question.** Compute the distance between 
$$
z = 2-4 i \,, \quad 
w = -5+i \,.
$$ 

**Solution.**
The distance is
\begin{align*}
|z- w|  & = |(2-4 i)-(-5+i)| \\
        & = |7-5 i| \\
        & =\sqrt{7^{2}+(-5)^{2}} \\
        & =\sqrt{74}
\end{align*}

### Properties of modulus

The modulus has the following properties.

::: Theorem 

Let $z, z_{1}, z_{2} \in \C$. Then

1. $\left|z_1 \cdot z_2\right|=\left|z_{1}\right|\left|z_{2}\right|$

2. $\left|z^{n}\right|=|z|^{n}$ for all $n \in \N$

3. $z \cdot \bar{z}=|z|^{2}$

:::

::: Proof

*Part 1.*
We have
\begin{align*}
z_1 \cdot z_2 & = (x_1 + i y_1) \cdot (x_2 + i y_2) \\
              & = (x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2) + i (x_2 y_1 + x_1 y_2) 
\end{align*}
and therefore 
\begin{align*}
|z_1 \cdot z_2| & = \sqrt{ (x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2)^2 + (x_2 y_1 + x_1 y_2)^2 }\\
                & = \sqrt{ x_1^2 x_2^2 + y_1^2 y_2^2 + x_2^2 y_1^2 + x_1^2 y_2^2 } \,.
\end{align*}
On the other hand,
$$
|z_1| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} \,, \quad 
|z_2| = \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}
$$
so that
\begin{align*}
|z_1| |z_2| & = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}  \\
& = \sqrt{ x_1^2 x_2^2 + y_1^2 y_2^2 + x_2^2 y_1^2 + x_1^2 y_2^2 }
\end{align*}
proving that $\left|z_1 \cdot z_2\right|=\left|z_{1}\right|\left|z_{2}\right|$.

*Part 2.* Exercise. It easily follows from Point 1 and induction.

*Part 3.* Let $z=x+ i y$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$. Then,

\begin{align*}
z \cdot \bar{z} & = (x+i y)(x- i y) \\
                & = x^{2}-(i y )^{2} \\
                & = x^{2}+y^{2} \\
                & =|z|^{2}
\end{align*}

The modulus in $\C$ satisfies the triangle inequality.


::: Theorem 
### Triangle inequality in $\C$ 

For all $x, y, z \in \C$,

1. $|x+y| \leq|x|+|y|$

2. $|x-z| \leq|x-y|+|y-z|$

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* Suppose that $x=a+ib$ and $y=c+ i d$ for $a, b, c, d \in \R$. Then,
$$
|x+y|=|(a+c)+i (b+d) |=\sqrt{(a+c)^{2}+(b+d)^{2}} \,.
$$
Therefore the inequality
$$
|x+y| \leq|x|+|y|
$${#eq-triangle-complex-1}
is equivalent to
$$
\sqrt{(a+c)^{2}+(b+d)^{2}} \leq \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + \sqrt{c^2 + d^2}\,.
$${#eq-triangle-complex-2}
Now note that, for $A,B \in \R$, we have that
$$
A^2 \leq B^2 \quad \implies \quad  |A| \leq |B| \,.
$${#eq-triangle-complex-4}
In the two reverse implications $\impliedby$ below we will use (@eq-triangle-complex-4):
\begin{align*}
& \, \sqrt{(a+c)^{2}+(b+d)^{2}} \leq \sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}+\sqrt{c^{2}+d^{2}} \\
\impliedby &  \, (a+c)^{2}+(b+d)^{2} \leq\left(\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}+\sqrt{c^{2}+d^{2}}\right)^{2} \\
\iff & \, a^{2}+2 a c+c^{2}+b^{2}+2 b d+d^{2} \leq a^{2}+b^{2}+2 \sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}} \sqrt{c^{2}+d^{2}}+c^{2}+d^{2} \\
\iff & \, a c+b d \leq \sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}} \sqrt{c^{2}+d^{2}} \\
\impliedby & \, (a c+b d)^{2} \leq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)\left(c^{2}+d^{2}\right) \\
\iff & \, a^{2} c^{2}+2 a b c d+b^{2} d^{2} \leq a^{2} c^{2}+a^{2} d^{2}+b^{2} c^{2}+b^{2} d^{2} \\
\iff & \, a^{2} d^{2}+b^{2} c^{2}-2 a b c d \geq 0 \\
\iff & \, (a d-b c)^{2} \geq 0 .
\end{align*}

This last statement is clearly true, since $a d-b c \in \R$. Therefore 
(@eq-triangle-complex-2) holds, and so (@eq-triangle-complex-1) follows.




*Part 2.* Using (@eq-triangle-complex-1) we estimate
$$
|x-z|=|x-y+y-z| \leq|x-y|+|y-z| .
$$

:::


::: Remark
### Geometric interpretation of triangle inequality

We finally have a justification of why the inequality
$$
|x-z| \leq |x-y| + |y - z|
$$
is called **triangle inequality**: By drawing three points $x, y, z \in \C$ in the complex plane, the distance between $x$ and $z$ is shorter than the distance to go from $x$ to $z$ via the point $y$, see @fig-triangle-inequality-C.

## Polar coordinates

We have seen that we can identify a complex number $z=x+iy$ by a point in the complex plane with Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. We can also specify the point $(x,y)$ by using the so-called polar coordinates $(\rho, \theta)$, where

- $\rho$ is the distance between $z$ and the origin
$$
\rho = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} 
$$

- $\theta$ is the angle between the line connecting the origin and $z$ and the positive real axis, see @fig-polar-coordinates.


![Polar coordinates $(\rho,\theta)$ for the complex number $z \in \C$. ](/images/polar_coordinates.png){#fig-polar-coordinates width=60%}


We give such angle a name.

::: Definition 
### Argument

Let $z \in \C$. The angle $\theta$ between the line connecting the origin and $z$ and the positive real axis is called the **argument** of $z$, and is denoted by
$$
\theta := \arg (z) \,.
$$

:::


::: Warning

We always use angles in radians, not degrees. Make sure your calculator is set to radians if you want to use it to compute angles.

:::


::: Remark
### Principal Value

The argument of a complex number is not uniquely defined. We can always add an integer number of times $2 \pi$ to the argument to specify the same point. We usually use the convention to choose the argument in the interval $(-\pi, \pi]$. This is called the **principal value** of the argument function. Therefore the complex numbers in the upper half plane have a positive argument, and the ones in the lower half plane have a negative argument.

:::



::: Example 
We have the following arguments:
\begin{align*}
& \arg (1) = 0  & \quad & \arg (i) = \frac{\pi}{2}  \\
& \arg (-1) = \pi   & \quad & \arg (-i) = -\frac{\pi}{2}  \\
& \arg (1+i)=\frac{1}{4} \pi & \quad &  \arg (-1-i)=-\frac{3}{4} \pi
\end{align*}

:::



We can represent any non-zero complex number in polar coordinates.


::: Theorem  
### Polar coordinates {#theorem-polar-coordinates}

Let $z \in \C$ with $z = x + i y$ and $z \neq 0$. Then
$$
x = \rho \cos(\theta) \,, \quad y = \rho \sin(\theta) \,,
$$
where 
$$
\rho := |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \,, \quad 
\theta := \arg(z) \,.
$$


:::

The proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-polar-coordinates} is trivial, and is based on basic trigonometry and definition of $\arg(z)$. Complex numbers in polar form can be useful. We give
a name to such polar form.

::: Definition 
### Trigonometric form

Let $z \in \mathbb{C}$. The trigonometric form of $z$ is
$$
z = |z| \left[ \cos (\theta)+i \sin (\theta) \right] \,,
$$
where $\theta = \arg(z)$.
:::





::: {.Example   #example-trigonometric-form} 

**Question.** Suppose that $z \in \C$ has polar coordinates
$$
\rho = \sqrt{8}\,, \quad   \theta = \frac{3}{4} \pi \,.
$$ 
Therefore, the trigonometric form of $z$ is
$$
z = \sqrt{8}  \left[ \cos \left( \frac{3}{4} \pi \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{3}{4} \pi \right)   \right] \,.
$$
Write $z$ in cartesian form.

**Solution.** We have
\begin{gather*}
x = \rho \cos (\theta) = \sqrt{8} \cos \left( \frac{3}{4} \pi \right) = - \sqrt{8} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -2 \\
y = \rho \sin (\theta) = \sqrt{8} \sin \left( \frac{3}{4} \pi \right) = \sqrt{8} \cdot  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2 \,.
\end{gather*}
Therefore, the cartesian form of $z$ is
$$
z = x + i y = - 2 + 2 i \,.
$$

:::


As a consequence of Theorem \ref{theorem-polar-coordinates} we obtain a formula for computing the argument.



::: Corollary
### Computing $\arg(z)$   {#corollary-arg}

Let $z \in \C$ with $z = x + i y$ and $z \neq 0$. Then
$$
\arg(z) = 
\begin{cases}
\arctan \left(  \dfrac{y}{x}   \right)  &  \,\, \mbox{ if }  x>0 \\
\arctan \left(  \dfrac{y}{x}   \right) + \pi   &  \,\, \mbox{ if }  x<0\,\, \mbox{and} \,\, y \geq 0 \\
\arctan \left(  \dfrac{y}{x}   \right) - \pi   &  \,\, \mbox{ if }  x<0\,\, \mbox{and} \,\, y < 0 \\
\dfrac{\pi}{2}    &  \,\, \mbox{ if }  x=0\,\, \mbox{and} \,\, y > 0 \\
-\dfrac{\pi}{2}    &  \,\, \mbox{ if }  x=0\,\, \mbox{and} \,\, y < 0 \\
\end{cases}
$$
where $\arctan$ is the inverse of $\tan$.

:::


::: Proof

Using the polar coordinates formulas from Theorem \ref{theorem-polar-coordinates}, we get
$$
\frac{y}{x} = \frac{\rho \sin(\theta)}{\rho \cos(\theta)}  = \tan (\theta) \,.
$$
The thesis can be obtained by carefully inverting the tangent: With reference to  @fig-argument-1 and @fig-argument, we have:

1. When $x>0$: Then $z = x + iy$ belongs to the 1st or 4th quadrant. Therefore the argument of $z$ is $\theta \in (-\pi/2,\pi /2)$. Such interval coincides with the domain of $\tan$, and therefore
$$
\theta =\arctan \left(  \dfrac{y}{x}   \right)  \,.
$$

2. When $x<0$ and $y \geq 0$: Then $z = x + iy$ lies in the 2nd quadrant. Thus, the argument of $z$ is $\theta \in (\pi/2,\pi)$. Hence 
$$
\theta =\arctan \left(  \dfrac{y}{x}   \right) + \pi  \,.
$$

3. When $x<0$ and $y < 0$: Then $z = x + iy$ lies in the 3rd quadrant. Thus, the argument of $z$ is $\theta \in (-\pi,\pi/2)$. Hence 
$$
\theta =\arctan \left(  \dfrac{y}{x}   \right) - \pi  \,.
$$

4. When $x=0$ and $y > 0$: Then $z = iy$ is imaginary with $y>0$, meaning that $\theta = \pi/2$.

5. When $x=0$ and $y < 0$: Then $z = iy$ is imaginary with $y<0$, meaning that $\theta = -\pi/2$.

This exhausts all the cases, and the proof is concluded.

## Exponential form

We have seen that we can represent complex numbers in 

- Cartesian form
- Trigonometric form

We now introduce a third way of representing complex numbers: the exponential form. For this, we need Euler's identity:


::: Theorem 
### Euler's identity   {#theorem-euler-identity}

For all $\theta \in \R$ it holds
$$
e^{i \theta}=\cos (\theta)+ i \sin (\theta) \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof 
The proof of this theorem uses complex power series. We have not yet introduced series. However, we carry out the proof formally, assuming that all the quantities below converge. We have the following Taylor series at $x_{0}=0$ (you might know them from calculus):
\begin{align*}
e^{x} & =1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2 !}+\frac{x^{3}}{3 !}+\frac{x^{4}}{4 !}+\frac{x^{5}}{5 !}+\frac{x^{6}}{6 !}+\frac{x^{7}}{7 !}+\ldots \\
\sin (x) & =\frac{x}{1 !}-\frac{x^{3}}{3 !}+\frac{x^{5}}{5 !}-\frac{x^{7}}{7 !}+\ldots \\
\cos (x) & =1-\frac{x^{2}}{2 !}+\frac{x^{4}}{4 !}-\frac{x^{6}}{6 !}+\ldots
\end{align*}
The above identities also hold for $x \in \C$. Hence we can substitute $x=i \theta$ in the series for $e^{x}$ to obtain
\begin{align*}
e^{i \theta} & =1+i \theta+\frac{(i \theta)^{2}}{2 !}+\frac{(i \theta)^{3}}{3 !}+\frac{(i \theta)^{4}}{4 !}+\frac{(i \theta)^{5}}{5 !}+\frac{(i \theta)^{6}}{6 !}+\frac{(i \theta)^{7}}{7 !} \ldots \\
& =1+i \theta-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2 !}-i \frac{\theta^{3}}{3 !}+\frac{\theta^{4}}{4 !}+i \frac{\theta^{5}}{5 !}-\frac{\theta^{6}}{6 !}-i \frac{\theta^{7}}{7 !}+\ldots \\
& =\cos (\theta)+i \sin (\theta),
\end{align*}
where in the second equality we used that $i^{2}=-1$, and where the third equality follows by observing that all terms with an even power of $\theta$ are exactly the terms in the expansion of $\cos (\theta)$, and all terms with an odd power of $\theta$ are exactly the terms in the expansion of $\sin (\theta)$ multiplied by $i$.

:::



::: Theorem 
For all $\theta \in \R$ it holds
$$
\left|e^{i \theta}\right|=1 \,.
$$

:::

::: Proof

 From Euler's identity in Theorem \ref{theorem-euler-identity} we get
$$
\left|e^{i \theta}\right|=|\cos (\theta)+i \sin (\theta)|=\sqrt{\cos ^{2}(\theta)+\sin ^{2}(\theta)}=1 \,.
$$

:::




::: Theorem

Let $z \in \C$ with $z = x+iy$ and $z \neq 0$. Then
$$
z = \rho e^{i\theta}\,,
$$
where 
$$
\rho := |z| =  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \,, \qquad 
\theta := \arg(z) \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

By Theorem \ref{theorem-polar-coordinates} we have
$$
x = \rho \cos(\theta)\,, \quad y = \rho \sin(\theta) \,.
$$
Hence 
\begin{align*}
z & = x + i y \\
  & = \rho \cos(\theta) + i \rho \sin(\theta) \\
  & = \rho e^{i\theta} \,,
\end{align*}
where in the last line we used Euler's identity in Theorem \ref{theorem-euler-identity}.
:::



::: Definition 
### Exponential form

The **exponential form** of a complex number $z \in \C$ is 
$$
z= \rho e^{i\theta} = |z| \, e^{i \arg(z)}  \,.
$$

:::



::: {.Example #example-exponential-form}

**Question.** Write the number 
$$
z=-2+2 i
$$ 
in exponential form.

**Solution.** From Example \ref{example-trigonometric-form} we know that $z = -2+2i$
can be written in trigonometric form as
$$
z = \sqrt{8}  \left[ \cos \left( \frac{3}{4} \pi \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{3}{4} \pi \right)   \right] \,.
$$
By Euler's identity we hence obtain the exponential form
$$
z=\sqrt{8} e^{i \frac{3}{4} \pi} \,.
$$
:::


::: Remark
### Periodicity of exponential

For all $k \in \Z$ we have
$$
e^{i \theta}=e^{i(\theta+2 \pi k)} \,,
$${#eq-exponential-periodic}
meaning that the complex exponential is $2\pi$-periodic. As we did for the principal value of the argument, we select $\theta$ in (@eq-exponential-periodic) so that $\theta \in(-\pi, \pi]$. 

> Equation (@eq-exponential-periodic) follows immediately by Euler's identity and periodicity of $\cos$ and $\sin$, since 
\begin{align*}
e^{i(\theta+2 \pi k)} & = \cos(\theta+2 \pi k) + i \sin (\theta+2 \pi k)  \\
& = \cos(\theta) + i \sin (\theta) = e^{i \theta} \,.
\end{align*}  

:::


The exponential form is very useful for computing products and powers of 
complex numbers.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-complex-exponential}

Let $z, z_1,z_2 \in \C$ and suppose that
$$
z= \rho e^{i \theta} \,, \quad 
z_1 = \rho_1 e^{i \theta_1}\,, \quad 
z_2 = \rho_2 e^{i \theta_2}\,.
$$
We have
$$
z_1 \cdot z_2 = \rho_1 \rho_2 e^{i (\theta_1 + \theta_2)}  \,, \quad 
z^n = \rho^n  e^{i n \theta} \,,
$$
for all $n \in \N$.
:::


The proof follows immediately by the properties of the exponential. 
Let us see some applications of Propostion \ref{proposition-complex-exponential}.


::: Example 

**Question.** Compute $(-2+2 i)^{4}$.

**Solution.** We have two possibilities:

1. Use the binomial theorem:
\begin{align*}
(-2+2 i)^{4} & =(-2)^{4}+\left(\begin{array}{l}
4 \\
1
\end{array}\right)(-2)^{3} \cdot 2 i+\left(\begin{array}{l}
4 \\
2
\end{array}\right)(-2)^{2} \cdot(2 i)^{2} \\
& \quad +\left(\begin{array}{l}
4 \\
3
\end{array}\right)(-2) \cdot(2 i)^{3}+(2 i)^{4} \\
& =16-4 \cdot 8 \cdot 2 i-6 \cdot 4 \cdot 4+4 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 i+16 \\
& =16-64 i-96+64 i+16=-64 \,.
\end{align*}

2. A much simpler calculation is possible by using the exponential form: We know that
$$
-2+2 i = \sqrt{8} e^{i \frac{3}{4} \pi} 
$$
by Example \ref{example-exponential-form}. Hence
$$
(-2+2 i)^{4}=\left(\sqrt{8} e^{i \frac{3}{4} \pi}\right)^{4}=8^{2} e^{i 3 \pi}=-64 \,,
$$
where we used that 
$$
e^{i 3 \pi} = e^{i \pi} = \cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi) = - 1
$$
by $2\pi$ periodicity of $e^{i\theta}$ and Euler's identity.

where the convergence is intendend in the sense of complex series. The properties at (@eq-complex-exponential) then follow from manipulating the series on the RHS of (@eq-complex-exponential-1).



::: Example

|i| = 1 \,, \quad \arg(i) = \frac{\pi}{2} \,.

$$
i= |i| e^{i\arg(i)} = e^{i \frac{\pi}{2}} \,.

Therefore
$$
i^{i}=\left(e^{i \frac{\pi}{2}}\right)^{i}=e^{i^2\frac{\pi}{2}}=e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}} \,.

## Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

We started the introduction to complex numbers with the following question: 

::: Question
Is there a number $x \in \R$ such that
$$
x^{2}=-1 \,\, ?
$${#eq-introduction-complex}
:::

The answer is no. For this reason we introduced the complex number $i$, which satisfies 
$$
i^{2}=-1 \,.
$$
Therefore (@eq-introduction-complex) has solution in $\C$, with $x = i$. Moreover, note that
$$
(-i)^{2}=(-1)^{2} i^{2}=-1 \,.
$$
Hence (@eq-introduction-complex) has two solutions in $\C$, given by
$$
x_1 = i \,, \quad x_2 = - i \,.
$$

It turns out that the set $\C$ is so large, that not only we are able to solve (@eq-introduction-complex), but in fact any polynomial equation.


::: Theorem 
### Fundamental theorem of algebra   {#theorem-fta}

Let $p_{n}(z)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ with complex coefficients, i.e.,
$$
p_{n}(z)=a_{n} z^{n}+a_{n-1} z^{n-1}+\ldots+a_{1} z+a_{0},
$$
for some coefficients $a_{n}, \ldots, a_{0} \in \C$ with $a_{n} \neq 0$. There exist 
$$
z_{1}, \ldots, z_{n} \in \C
$$ 
solutions to the polynomial equation
$$
p_n(z) = a_{n} z^{n}+a_{n-1} z^{n-1}+\ldots+a_{1} z+a_{0}=0 \,.
$${#eq-fta}
In particular, $p_n$ factorizes as
$$
p_{n}(z)=a_{n}\left(z-z_{1}\right)\left(z-z_{2}\right) \cdots\left(z-z_{n}\right) \,.
$${#eq-fta-0}

Theorem \ref{theorem-fta} says that equation (@eq-fta) admits $n$ complex solutions:

- We call these solutions *zeros*, or also *roots*.
- We call the expression (@eq-fta-0) a *factorization* of the 
 polynomial $p_n$.
 

Several proofs of Theorem \ref{theorem-fta} exist in the literature, 
but they all use mathematical tools which are out of reach for now. Therefore we will not show a proof. For example one can prove Theorem \ref{theorem-fta} by

- Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)
- Homotopy arguments (general topology)
- Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory (algebra)


::: Example 

**Question.** Find all the complex solutions to

$${#eq-fta-example-1}

**Solution.** The equation $z^2 = -1$ is equivalent to
$$
p(z) = 0 \,, \quad p(z):=z^{2}+1  \,.
$$
Since $p$ has degree $n=2$, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tells us that there are two solutions to (@eq-fta-example-1). We have already seen that these two solutions are $z=i$ and $z=-i$. Then $p$ factorizes as
$$
p(z) = z^{2} + 1 = (z-i)(z+i) \,.

$$
a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b) \,, \quad \forall \, a,b \in \R \,,

to factorize $p$. We get:
$$
p(z) = (z^4-1) = (z^2+1)(z^2-1) \,.

z^2 - 1 = 0 
$$
has solutions $x = \pm 1$. Hence, the four solutions of (@eq-fta-example-2) are given by 
$$
z=1,-1, i,-i \,,
$$
and $p$ factorizes as
$$
p(z) = z^4 - 1 = (z-1)(z+1)(z-i)(z+i) \,.

$$
with $a_n \neq 0$, $z_1,\ldots, z_m \in \C$ and $k_1, \ldots , k_m \in \N$, $k_i \geq 1$. In this case $p_n$ has degree
$$

Note that $z_i$ is solves the equation

## Solving polynomial equations

The non-factorized version of the polynomial
$$
p(z) = (z-1)(z-2)^2(z+i)^3
$${#eq-polynomial-20}
from Example \ref{example-multiplicity} is 
$$

\end{aligned}
$${#eq-polynomial-21}
Question: How do we figure out the factorization at (@eq-polynomial-20) if we are given $p$ in the form at (@eq-polynomial-20)? More in general, consider the following question:

::: Question

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that 
$$
p_n(z) = 0
$${#eq-abel-ruffini}
has $n$ complex solutions. How do we find such solutions in practice?

:::


Answer: There is no general formula to solve (@eq-abel-ruffini)
when $n \geq 5$. This is the content of the Abel-Ruffini Theorem.

::: Theorem
### Abel-Ruffini    {#theorem-abel-ruffini}

There is no elementary solution formula to the polynomial equation
$$
p_n(z) = 0 \,,
$$
with $p_n$ polynomial of degree $n$, with $n \geq 5$.

:::

Similarly to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, the proof of the
Abel-Ruffini Theorem is out of reach for now. A proof can be carried out, for example, using Galois Theory.


There are however explicit formulas for solving (@eq-abel-ruffini)
when $p_n$ has degree $n=2,3,4$. 


### Quadratic polynomials 

Consider polynomial equations of order $n=2$, that is, equations of the form
$$
a z^{2}+b z+c=0 \,.
$${#eq-quadratic-formula}
When the coefficients $a,b,c$ are real, the solutions are given by the well-known quadratic formula. 


::: Proposition
### Quadratic formula    {#proposition-quadratic-formula}

Let $a, b, c \in \R, a \neq 0$ and consider the equation at (@eq-quadratic-formula). 
Define 
$$
\Delta := b^2 - 4 ac \in \R \,.
$$
The following hold:

1. If $\Delta > 0$ then (@eq-quadratic-formula) has two distinct real solutions $z_1,z_2 \in \R$ given by
$$
z_1 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2 a} \,, 
\quad 
z_2 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2 a} \,.
$$
2. If $\Delta = 0$ then (@eq-quadratic-formula) has one real solution $z \in \R$ with multiplicity $2$. Such solution is given by
$$
z = z_1 = z_2 = \frac{-b}{2 a} \,.
$$
3. If $\Delta < 0$ then (@eq-quadratic-formula) has two distinct complex solutions $z_1,z_2 \in \C$ given by 
$$
z_1 = \frac{-b - i\sqrt{-\Delta}}{2 a} \,, 
\quad 
z_2 = \frac{-b + i\sqrt{-\Delta}}{2 a} \,,
$$
where $\sqrt{-\Delta} \in \R$, since $-\Delta>0$.

In all cases, the polynomial at (@eq-quadratic-formula) factorizes as
$$
a z^{2}+b z+c = a (z-z_1)(z-z_2) \,.
$$

:::




::: Example 


**Question.** Solve the following equations:

1. $3 z^{2}-6 z+2 = 0$
2. $4 z^{2}-8 z+4=0$
3. $z^{2}+2 z+3=0$

**Solution.**

1. We have that
$$
\Delta = (-6)^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 12 > 0
$$
Therefore the equation has two distinct real solutions, given by
$$
z=\frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{12}}{2 \cdot 3}=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{12}}{6}=1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
$$
In particular we have the factorization
$$
3 z^{2}-6 z+2  = 3 \left( z - 1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \right) \left( z - 1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \right) \,.
$$



2. We have that 
$$
\Delta = (-8)^{2}-4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 0 \,.
$$
Therefore there exists one solution with multiplicity $2$. This
is given by
$$
z=\frac{-(-8)}{2 \cdot 4} = 1 \,.
$$
In particular we have the factorization
$$
4 z^{2}-8 x+4 = 4 (z-1)^2 \,.
$$



3. We have
$$
\Delta = 2^{2}-4 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 = - 8 < 0 \,.
$$
Therefore there are two complex solutions given by
$$
z=\frac{-2 \pm i \sqrt{8}}{2 \cdot 1} = -1 \pm i \sqrt{2}  \,.
$$
In particular we have the factorization
$$
z^{2}+2 z+3 = (z + 1 - i \sqrt{2}) (z + 1 + i\sqrt{2}) \,.
$$

:::


So far we have considered the polynomial equation
$$
az^2 + bz + c = 0 \,,
$${#eq-second-order-1}
for $a,b,c \in \R$ and $a \neq 0$. 


::: Question

What if $a,b,c \in \C$?

:::

If $a, b, c \in \C$ then we might have
$$
\Delta := b^{2}-4 a c \in \C \,.
$$ 
Therefore it is not clear how to compute
$$
\sqrt{\Delta} \,.
$$
However, we can still use the quadratic equation to solve (@eq-second-order-1), as outlined in the next Proposition.


::: Proposition   
### Quadratic formula with complex coefficients {#proposition-quadratic-formula-C}

Let $a, b, c \in \C, a \neq 0$. The two solutions to 
$$
a z^{2}+b z + c=0
$$ 
are given by
$$
z_1 = \frac{-b + S_1}{2 a} \,, 
\quad 
z_2 = \frac{-b + S_2}{2 a} \,, 
$$
where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the two solutions to
$$
z^2 = \Delta \,, \quad \Delta := b^2 - 4ac \,.
$$

:::


::: Remark

We want to check that the new formulas
$$
z_1 = \frac{-b + S_1}{2 a} \,, 
\quad 
z_2 = \frac{-b + S_2}{2 a} \,, \quad S_1^2 =S_2^2 = \Delta \,,
$$ 
agree with the old formulas given in Proposition 
\ref{proposition-quadratic-formula}, when $a,b,c \in \R$. 

To this end, note that 
$$
\Delta \in \R \,,
$$
when $a,b,c \in \R$. In this case the equation
$$
z^2 = \Delta
$$
has the following solutions:

- If $\Delta>0$ there are two real solutions
$$
S_1 =  -\sqrt{\Delta} \,, \quad S_2 = \sqrt{\Delta} \,.
$$
- If $\Delta = 0$ then $0$ is the only solution with multiplicity $2$. Hence
$$
S_1 = S_2 = 0   \,.
$$
- If $\Delta<0$, there are two complex solutions
$$
S_1 = - i  \sqrt{-\Delta} \,, \quad
S_2 =  i  \sqrt{-\Delta} \,.
$$

Therefore the solutions 
$$
z_1 = \frac{-b + S_1}{2 a} \,, 
\quad 
z_2 = \frac{-b + S_2}{2 a} \,, 
$$
given in Proposition 
\ref{proposition-quadratic-formula} coincide with the ones 
given in Proposition \ref{proposition-quadratic-formula-C}.

::: Example

**Question** Find all the solutions to
$$
\frac{1}{2} z^{2}-(3+i) z+(4-i)=0 \,.
$${#eq-example-complex-delta}

**Solution.** We have
\begin{align*}
\Delta & = (-(3+i))^{2}-4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot(4-i) \\
       & = 8+6 i-8+2 i \\
       & =8 i \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore $\Delta \in \C$. We have to find solutions $S_1$ and $S_2$ to the equation
$$
z^2 = \Delta = 8i \,.
$${#eq-example-complex-delta-2}
We look for solutions of the form $z=a+ i b$. Then we must have that
$$
z^{2}=(a+ ib)^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}+2 a b i = 8 i \,.
$$
Thus
$$
a^{2}-b^{2}=0 \,, \quad 2 a b = 8  \,.
$$ 
From the first equation we conclude that $|a|=|b|$. From the second equation we have that $ab=4$, and therefore $a$ and $b$ must have the same sign. Hence $a=b$, and 
$$
2 a b = 8 \quad \implies \quad a = b = \pm 2 \,.
$$
From this we conclude that the solutions to (@eq-example-complex-delta-2)
are 
$$
S_{1} = 2+2 i \,, \quad  S_{2}=-2-2 i \,. 
$$
 Hence the solutions to (@eq-example-complex-delta) are
\begin{align*}
z_1 & = \frac{3+i+S_{1}}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}}  = 3 + i + S_{1} \\
    & = 3 + i + 2 + 2i = 5 + 3i \,, 
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{align*}
z_2 & = \frac{3+i+S_{2}}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}}  = 3+i+S_{2} \\
    & = 3+i -2 - 2i  = 1 - i \,. 
\end{align*}
In particular, the given polynomial factorizes as
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} z^{2}-(3+i) z+(4-i) & = \frac12 (z - z_1)(z-z_2) \\
                                & = \frac12 (z - 5 - 3i)(z - 1 + i) \,. 
\end{align*}

:::



In the above example it was a bit laborious to compute $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$. In @sec-roots-1 and @sec-roots-2, we will explore a more general method to solve problems of the form
$$
z^n = \Delta \,.
$$



### Higher order polynomials

Consider now polynomial equations 
$$
p_n(z) = 0 \,,
$$
with $p_n$ of degree $n=3,4$. Although general solution formulas exist for these cases, they are exceedingly lengthy, making them impractical for manual calculations. For example, @fig-quartic shows the solution formula to the quartic equation
$$
z^4 + az^3 + bz^2 + cz + d = 0  \,,
$$
when $a,b,c,d \in \R$.

A more productive use of time is learning how to perform long polynomial division. A quick tutorial is available here: [Polynomial_division.pdf](downloads/Polynomial_Division.pdf).


::: Example

**Question.** Divide $6z^3+5z^2-7$ by $3z^2-2z-1$.

**Solution.** Using polynomial division, see @fig-polynomial-10, we obtain
$$
6z^3+5z^2-7 = (3z^2-2z-1)(2z+3) + (8z-4)  \,.
$$

Sometimes, it is possible to solve equations of degree higher than 2, in case it is obvious from inspection that a certain number is a solution, e.g., when $z=-1,0,1$ is a solution.


::: Example 

**Question.** Consider the equation
$$
z^{3}-7 z^{2}+6 z=0 \,.
$$ 

1. Check whether $z=0,1,-1$ are solutions.
2. Using your answer from Point 1, and polynomial division, find all the solutions.

**Solution.**

1. By direct inspection we see that $z=0$ and $z=1$ are solutions.

2. Since $z = 0$ is a solution, we can factorize
$$
z^{3}-7 z^{2}+6 z=z\left(z^{2}-7 z+6\right) \,.
$$
We could now use the quadratic formula on the term $z^{2}-7 z+6$ to find the remaining two roots. However, we have already observed that $z=1$ is a solution. Therefore $z-1$ divides $z^{2}-7 z+6$. Using polynomial long division, see @fig-polynomial, we find that
$$
\frac{z^{2}-7 z+6}{z-1}=z-6 \,.
$$
Therefore the last solution is $z=6$, and
$$
z^{3}-7 z^{2}+6 z=z(z-1)(z-6) \,.
$$

:::


![Polynomial long division between $z^{2}-7 z+6$ and $z-1$.](/images/polynomial_1.png){#fig-polynomial width=50%}




::: Example

**Question.** Find all the complex solutions to
$$
z^{3}-7 z+6=0 \,.
$$ 

**Solution.** It is easy to see $z=1$ is a solution. This means that $z-1$ divides $z^{3}-7 z+6$. By using polynomial long division, see @fig-polynomial-1, we compute that
$$
\frac{z^{3}-7 z+6}{z-1}=z^{2}+z-6 \,.
$$
We are now left to solve
$$
z^{2}+z-6 = 0\,.
$$
Using the quadratic formula, we see that the above is solved by $z=2$ and $z=-3$.
Therefore the given polynomial factorizes as
$$
z^{3}-7 z+6 = (z-1)(z-2)(z+3) \,.
$$

**Question.** Consider the equation
$$
z^3 + 5 z^2 + (5 - i) z + (4 - 4 i) = 0 \,.
$$

1. Check whether $z = \pm i$ and $z = 0, \pm 1$ are solutions. 
2. By using polynomial division with complex coefficients, find all the solutions.

**Solution.** 

1. By direct inspection, we see that $z = i$ is a solution. 

2. Since $z = i$ is a solution, we know that $z-i$ divides 
$z^3 + 5 z^2 + (5 - i) z + (4 - 4 i)$. We now perform polynomial division by using the same method employed to divide polynomials with real coefficients: We just need to be mindful of the fact that coefficients are now complex, and thus, addition and multiplication have to be carried out in $\C$. Using polynomial long division, see @fig-polynomial-5, we compute that
$$
z^3 + 5 z^2 + (5 - i) z + (4 - 4 i) = (z-i)(z^2 + (5+i) z + (4-4i)) \,.
$$
We are now left to solve the second order equation
$$
z^2 + (5+i) z + (4-4i) = 0 \,.
$$
We compute that
$$
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (5+1)^2 - 4 (4-4i) = 4(5+4i) \,.
$$
We now need to solve
$$
z^2 = \Delta \,.
$$
We look for a solution in the form of $z=a+ib$. 
$$
z^{2}=(a+ ib)^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}+2 a b i = 8 i \,.
$$
Thus
$$
a^{2}-b^{2}=0 \,, \quad 2 a b = 8  \,.
$$ 
From the first equation we conclude that $|a|=|b|$. From the second equation we have that $ab=4$, and therefore $a$ and $b$ must have the same sign. Hence $a=b$, and 
$$
2 a b = 8 \quad \implies \quad a = b = \pm 2 \,.
$$
From this we conclude that the solutions to (@eq-example-complex-delta-2)
are 
$$
S_{1} = 2+2 i \,, \quad  S_{2}=-2-2 i \,. 
$$
Hence the solutions to (@eq-example-complex-delta) are
\begin{align*}
z_1 & = \frac{3+i+S_{1}}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}}  = 3 + i + S_{1} \\
    & = 3 + i + 2 + 2i = 5 + 3i \,, 
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{align*}
z_2 & = \frac{3+i+S_{2}}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}}  = 3+i+S_{2} \\
    & = 3+i -2 - 2i  = 1 - i \,. 
\end{align*}
In particular, the given polynomial factorizes as
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} z^{2}-(3+i) z+(4-i) & = \frac12 (z - z_1)(z-z_2) \\
                                & = \frac12 (z - 5 - 3i)(z - 1 + i) \,.

## Roots of unity {#sec-roots-1}


::: Problem 

Let $n \in \N$. We want to find all complex solutions to
$$
z^{n}=1 \,.

:::

Note that $z=1$ is always a solution to (@eq-root-unity) if $n$ is even. In such case also $z=-1$ is a solution. If we were only looking for solutions
in $\R$, these two would be the only solutions.

However, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, see Theorem \ref{theorem-fta}, tells us that there are $n$ complex solutions to (@eq-root-unity). 


::: Question

Is there a way to find all $n$ solutions?

::: Example 

We have seen in Example \ref{example-degree-4} that the solutions to

However, we could only compute these solutions thanks to the clever factorization
$$
z^{4}-1 = (z^2 + 1)(z^2 - 1) = (z+i)(z-i)(z+1)(z-1) \,.
$$
It is not clear if and how this trick can be generalized to solve
$$
z^n = 1
$$
for arbitrary $n \in \N$.

:::


The trick to find all $n$ solutions to (@eq-root-unity) is to use 
the exponential form.


::: Theorem

Let $n \in \N$ and consider the equation

$${#eq-root-unity-1}
All the $n$ solutions to (@eq-root-unity-1) are given by
$$
z_k = \exp \left(i \frac{2 \pi k}{n}\right) \,, \quad k = 0, \ldots, n-1 \,,

where $\exp(x)$ denotes $e^x$.

:::

::: Proof

Rewrite $1$ in exponential form:
$$
1=|1|e^{i \arg(1)} =e^{i 2 \pi k} \, , \quad k \in \Z \,.
$$
Therefore (@eq-root-unity-1) is equivalent to
$$
z^n = e^{i 2 \pi k} \,.
$$
By the properties of the exponential, we see that the above is solved by
$$
z_k = \exp \left(i \frac{2 \pi k}{n}\right), \quad k \in \Z \,.
$$
By choosing $k = 0, \ldots, n-1$ we obtain $n$ different solutions.


:::


::: Definition 

The $n$ solutions to 
$$
z^{n}=1

are called the **roots of unity**.

**Question.** Find all the solutions to
$$

$$
z_k = \exp \left(i \frac{2 \pi k}{4} \right) = \exp \left(i \frac{\pi k}{2} \right)  \,,

for $k=0,1,2,3$. We compute:

z_2 & = e^{i \pi}=-1 \,, & \quad & z_3 = e^{i \frac{3 \pi}{2}}=-i \, .

Note that for $k=4$ we would again get the solution $z=e^{i 2 \pi}=1$.

z_0=e^{i 0}=1, \quad z_1=e^{i \frac{2 \pi}{3}}, \quad z_2=e^{i \frac{4 \pi}{3}} .

## Roots in $\C$ {#sec-roots-2}



Let $n \in \N$ and $c \in \C$. We want to give a meaning to
$$
\sqrt[n]{c} \,.
$$
This means, we want to find all complex solutions to
$$
z^{n}=c \,.
$$
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ensures that the above equation has $n$ 
complex solutions. To find these solutions, we pass to the exponential
form.


::: Theorem

Let $n \in \N$, $c \in \C$ and consider the equation
$$
z^{n}=c \,.
$${#eq-root-C}
All the $n$ solutions to (@eq-root-C) are given by
$$
z_k = \sqrt[n]{|c|} \, \exp \left(i \, \frac{\theta + 2 \pi k}{n}\right) \,, \quad k = 0, \ldots, n-1 \,,
$$
where $\sqrt[n]{|c|}$ is the $n$-th root of the real number $|c|$, and $\theta = \arg(c)$.

:::

::: Proof

Write $c$ in exponential form:
$$
c=|c|e^{i \theta} =|c| e^{i(\theta + 2 \pi k)} \, , \quad k \in \Z \,,
$$
where $\theta = \arg(c)$. Therefore (@eq-root-C) is equivalent to
$$
z^n = |c| e^{i(\theta + 2 \pi k)} \,.
$$
By the properties of the exponential, we see that the above is solved by
$$
z_k= \sqrt[n]{|c|} \exp \left(i \, \frac{\theta + 2 \pi k}{n}\right), \quad k \in \Z \,.
$$
By choosing $k = 0, \ldots, n-1$ we obtain $n$ different solutions.

::: Warning
### The n-th root function is multi-valued

The above result and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tell us that 
$$
z_0, \ldots, z_{n-1} 
$$
are $n$ solutions to
$$
z^n = c \,.
$$
This means that the complex number $c$ has multiple $n$-th roots, exaclty $n$. In particular, the $n$-th root function in $\C$ is multi-valued:
$$
\sqrt[n]{c} = \{ z_0, \ldots, z_{n-1} \} \,.
$$

:::




::: Example

**Question.** Find all the $z \in \C$ such that
$$
z^{5}=-32 \,.
$$

**Solution.** Let $c = -32$. We have
$$
|c| = |-32|=32=2^{5}\,, \quad \theta = \arg (-32)=\pi \,.
$$ 
The $5$ solutions are given by
$$
z_k =  \left(2^{5}\right)^{\frac{1}{5}} \exp \left(i \pi \, \frac{1+2 k}{5} \right) \,, \quad k \in \Z \,,
$$
for $k=0,1,2,3,4$. We get
\begin{align*}
z_0 & = 2 e^{i \frac{\pi}{5}} \,  & \quad & z_1 = 2 e^{i \frac{3 \pi}{5}}  \\ 
z_2 & = 2 e^{i \pi}=-2 \,  & \quad & z_3=2 e^{i \frac{7 \pi}{5}}  \\
z_4 &= 2 e^{i \frac{9 \pi}{5}}  & \quad &

**Question.** Find all the $z \in \C$ such that
$$

$$

**Solution.** Set 
$$
c:=9\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right) \,.
$$
The complex number $c$ is already in the trigonometric form, so that we can immediately obtain
$$
|c| = 9 \,, \quad \theta = \arg(c) = \frac{\pi}{3} \,.

The $4$ solutions are given by

for $k=0,1,2,3$. We compute
\begin{align*}
z_0 & = \sqrt{3} e^{i \pi \frac{1}{12}} & \quad & z_1 = \sqrt{3} e^{i \pi \frac{7}{12}} \\
z_2 & = \sqrt{3} e^{i \pi \frac{13}{12}}  & \quad &  z_3 = \sqrt{3} e^{i \pi \frac{19}{12}} 
\end{align*}
