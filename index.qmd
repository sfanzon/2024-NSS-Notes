## Readings {.unnumbered}

We will study the set of real numbers $\R$, and then sequences and series in $\R$. I will follow mainly the textbook by Bartle and Sherbert [@bartle]. Another good reading is the book by Abbott [@abbott]. I also point out the classic book by Rudin [@rudin_introduction], although this is more difficult to understand.
